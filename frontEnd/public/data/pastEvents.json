Participants learn the tips and hints for successful \"location photography\u201d  &amp; close up macro photography.\" At the same time acquiring the knowledge of the camera basic, the various functions and camera settings to gain greater control. By the end of the three hour class Participants are proficient in Manual Mode settings taking more successful photographs. Each Composition in the Field class begins with a brief introduction with Participants take walking instruction through one of a variety of photogenic locales (determined prior to the class). Participants put to practice the workshops lesson during this three-hour session. During the class, students learn and apply new concepts like panning and depth of field. Another skill is the understanding of the correct use of selective focus to add another dimension to their photos... literally. Much of the time, depth of field is used to accentuate beautiful natural scenes. Another creative use is in Portrait Photography where the focus is only on the eyes. It can be used in any situation to create a more interesting and complex image. For these strategies, I give instruction on both the fundamental mechanics of the technique and ways to apply it to improve the everyday photograph. Throughout the workshop lessons the participants are given exercises to increase their \u201cArt of Seeing Through the Lens\u201d as well as ways to look at the composition of their images by gaining an understanding of the transition of seeing from a multidimensional world to the camera. Images captured in the camera are expressed to the viewer in 2 dimensions length and width.The Art of Seeing covers techniques to create illusions of space, making the right lens choices, camera angles and light modifying effects. With my over 25 years of experience as a photography, printer and professional photographer I will guide the Participants through each step of the process in a fun three-hour session. Over the entire workshop series they will learn to shoot strategically, getting more interesting photos and come away with a foundation to improve their photographs in the future, whether for work and or pleasure.

Searching for something clever to call the show, Godfrey Townsend and his band came up with this play on words ... Clapton is GOD-frey. After hearing Godfrey jamming on some Cream tunes in a club one night, Eric Clapton's guitar tech, Lee Dickson commented to John Entwistle of The Who: \"This guy's got Clapton down better than Clapton!\" Townsend's mastery is so complete that Jack Bruce (bassist, vocalist, and songwriter of Cream), has been recruiting Townsend and his band to back him up for the better part of the last decade. Godfrey and his band have been performing to sold-out crowds at B.B. Kings Blues Club in New York City's Times Square with their tribute to Eric Clapton for the past 15 years. This tribute show is the longest-running successfully on-going show B.B.'s has ever had. Spanning four decades of Clapton's amazing career, Townsend and his band maintain a large repertoire of material, constantly adding and switching up songs from different eras for a fresh musical experience every time. This is not just another cover band - no tribute band look-a-like actors here. Townsend and his band of world-class musicians authentically capture the essence of a musical evening with Eric Clapton. What made Clapton unique? Rather than simply replicating the blues riffs he'd heard on record, Clapton incorporated the emotion of the original performances into his own style of playing, thus expanding the vocabulary of blues guitar. The only triple inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of both The Yardbirds and Cream and as a solo artist), Clapton continues to astonish and delight a vast spectrum of music lovers. \"At the age of 18 I didn't expect to live beyond 25, you know, and when I did I was very surprised...\" -Eric Clapton Godfrey Townsend >> Godfrey Townsend @ Facebook >> Godfrey Townsend @ Myspace >>",

Our 70+ events a year in 30+ markets has helped discover some of today's most sought after record producers. This year we intend to take steps to do the same for the up and coming songwriters on 3.21.2017 in NYC with the iStandard 'iWrite' Songwriter Experience. With the shift in the music industry leaning towards shopping full songs and tracks with hooks, the songwriter is now (more than ever) an extremely valuable asset to producers when pitching records for major label and flim/tv placements. With 'iWrite' we are basically using the same format as we do with the iStandard Producer Showcase. Each writer will showcase 3 (60 second) song or tracks w/ hook snippets and will be verbally judged on 5 Core criteria (Originality, Quality, Marketability, Melody/Structure and Overall Potential) by grammy winning songwriters, music execs, publishers and various industry tastemakers. The winning songwriter with the highest score overall will win a prize package consisting of a Grammy winning producer studio session, Record label &amp; Publishing entity listening sessions &amp; meetings, Video consultations, interviews and much more.\n\nJudges Include\n\n\n\tArden \"Keyz\" Altino (Songwriter/Composer for Jay-Z, Justin Beiber, Keyshia Cole, etc)\n\tKasual Kas (Director of A&amp;R at Playbook/KWL Enterprises)\n\tBrian Johnston (Senior Director of A&amp;R at Atlantic Records)\n\nThe Event Is Powered by ASCAP\n\nSubmit to the iStandard 'iWrite' Songwriter Showcase here at http://istandardproducers.com/showcase_submit\n",

Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction \u2013 at least 30 minutes\n\nIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment \u2013 30 minutes\n\nCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica \u2013 30 minutes\n\nCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\n\n\nElective - 2 hours\n\nThe instructor will teach two to four of the following topics:\n\nScaffold Hazard Awareness\n\nThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation Hazards\n\nExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard Introduction\n\nIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder Safety\n\nLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory Protection\n\nThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomics\n\nThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health Program\n\nThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour\n\nThere is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n\nFor more information about New York Safety and Training and our other safety classes, visit our website at\nwww.NYSafetyandTraining.com\nor contact Sharon O'Donnell at\n(718) 734-8400   or Sharon@NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\n",

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nThis webinar will show how a risk manual can be developed and used, to design, perform, monitor and communicate business risk management.\n\nOverview :\n\nCommunicating about corporate risk management, enterprise risk management, and compliance, is never easy. It is done more easily, however, when the communications relate to what people do, and what is expected of them. What is expected of them can be communicated as the goals for what they do, and can be compared to the results of what they have done. And, both the results and the goals can best be seen as the end products of their work. Those end products are the outcomes \u2013 the results \u2013 of their assigned work \u2013 of their participation in the assigned enterprise risk management framework.\n\nAlthough companies often organize policies, procedures, plans and controls by organization components and subject matter \u2013 by function \u2013 organizing information and communication by business process enables lower costs, more focus, and greater accountability, among other benefits. When business processes are the focus, then the emphasis on communication, risk management and control can be on the outputs of those business processes; and, in turn, those outputs are the focus of risk management (basically, the purpose of risk management is to eliminate or mitigate unacceptable levels of uncertainty in the outputs of business processes due to factors affecting the outputs of business processes).\n\nEnterprise risk management training, to communicate efficiently and effectively throughout the organization about risk, a risk manual is a very useful tool. It enables presenting, by business process, the means of eliminating or mitigating risk in order to achieve acceptable levels of risk; and in doing so, enabling the integration of risk management program, control, and compliance.\n\nThis strategic management coursebegins with a review of a typical business process framework, which can be easily tailored to your organization, in the context of, and interacting with, outside related parties. These interactions are the bases for risk and compliance, and the organization\u2019s responses are the basis of control, so that business process framework enables defining the range of process outcomes, of process outputs, and whether these ranges are acceptable from the standpoint of both internal and external compliance, and internal control.\n\nThis webinar then will illustrate a risk manual and the tools for designing, using and communicating risk. These examples will show practical approaches that organizations have used successfully.In closing, recommended actions for measuring and monitoring an integrated approach to risk, control and compliance management will be presented.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nYou should attend if you are afraid of stakeholder reactions to the bad press from such matters as auditor comments about poor risk management and control, of regulator comments and ensuing actions due to compliance issues, and/or of unexpected performance problems due to failures to mitigate risks effectively, or failures to anticipate risks. Building monitoring into all business processes by using a risk manual, and having in place objective means of measuring and reporting on monitoring of risk, control and compliance can reduce the concerns about exposures to bad press.\n\nBeyond bad press are the fears and uncertainties of internal disharmony due to the inability of cross-functional teams to get the results desired from their efforts to manage risk and compliance. Cross-functional teams are the approach used by many organizations to address these matters, but there is a better answer, deriving from a business-process approach to managing risk, control and compliance. This approach will be presented in this webinar.\n\nUncertainty is built into risk, because the consequences of the causes of risk are shaped by the possibility of future events and the conditions that result from them. Good risk management can mitigate this uncertainty, by incorporating effective measuring and monitoring -- and, of course, effective planning and communication (which also should be monitored) \u2013 into business processes.\n\nSome people feel that being able to measure the level of risk, control and compliance management is uncertain, and doubt that it can be done. However, if objective and relevant measures are applied to the outcomes \u2013 the outputs -- of business processes, then it is likely that these matters can be monitored, and reported, in a way that enable the organization to be more comfortable with its exposures to fears, uncertainties and doubts.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nThis webinar will begin by defining why a business-process focus enables better management and communication of risk, control and compliance.\n\nThe webinarthen will define what a business process is, and will present a business process frameworkthat comprises the general scope of any organization by its component processes, activities and task; and then, for each activity, will identify its inputs, outputs, the controls and constraints on it, and the tools and mechanisms \u2013 including the performers themselves -- used to perform it, so that it provides an integrated view of work. That integrated view of the work can be documented in related policy and procedure, which should identify the who, what, why, where, when and how\u2014or said more completely, who does the work, how the work is done, why the work is done, where the work is done, when the work is done, and what \"the work\" is.\n\nThe webinar will present IDEF as a framework for each activity of a business process, as well as a composite framework for the overall set of business processes. For this, the webinar will present Michaels Porter\u2019s value chain of nine process sets \u2013 five in what he calls the value chain, and four process sets in what he identifies as infrastructure. From that, the webinar will use those nine process sets to dig down, through several levels of specificity, to components of each process set, down to activities, in many cases. These activities and their flows -- the who, what where, when, why and how -- will be defined in general, in what is called the logical design -- and then can be tailored to the conditions of the specific enterprise -- in what is called the physical design -- and then can be connected to each other because the output of one activity can become the input to another activity, and it is that output where risk, control and measuring and monitoring can reside, where compliance management is. Relevant metrics -- key risk and control indicators \u2013 will be presented and examples of their use will be described.\n\nThe webinar will look more closely at how business processes can be defined and organized, to shape measuring, monitoring, communicating and managing.An organization has three types of related and reinforcing business processes: design processes for defining and directing what is to be done, execution processes for doing what is to be done, and monitoring processes \u2013 is for confirming that by doing \u201cit,\u201d the intended results are achieved.\n\nThis categorization of process types and the processes themselves can shape the table of contents for a risk manual dealing with measuring and monitoring.\n\nSuch a manual can help youto determine -- by applying the tools to the areas discussed -- that all of the components of an activity are appropriate, evident and consistent, and if they link well to the preceding and the following activities. In effect, this framework can establish the basis \u2013 the content -- for each page of the manual, actual examples of which will be sown and discussed.\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nLearn how to apply business-process design, measurement, communication and monitoring\n\nLearn business-process management \u2013 for risk, control and compliance management\n\nLearn why this approach is more effective and efficient than functional management\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nLeaders and Members of Cross-functional Teams dealing with Risk, Control and Compliance Management\n\nOperations Staff\n\nAccounting Personnel\n\nIT Staff\n\nAuditing Personnel\n\nLine Personnel\n\nFor more information, please visit : https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/c...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nMalcolm Schwartz\n\nUntil his recent retirement from PwC, Mr. Schwartz had been the partner responsible for the consumer products industry management consulting practice in its Eastern Region.

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nThis webinar will discuss the function and requirements of Form W-4 and how the information it provides is critical to the payroll process as well as how to avoid problems and identify and correct problems such as invalid or improperly filled out forms and errors in processing. It will also discuss the proper handling of special situations and requirements such as employee taxation exemption from withholding and nonresident alien W-4 Forms.\n\nOverview :\n\nForm W-4 has just seven lines but it is a fundamental part of the payroll process. In addition to information concerning the amount to withhold for income tax, the W-4 provides the employer with documentation of due diligence in soliciting employee name, Social Security Number, and address information. It is critical for penalty mitigation in the event the information is incorrect.\n\nThe Form provides a basis to have the correct amount of tax for employee withholding, but if it is prepared incorrectly, the employee may be subject to penalties. While the employer is not responsible for assuring correctness of the employee\u2019s claims, the employer is responsible for due diligence with regard to invalid forms and withholding according to the employee instructions provided by the form.\n\nImproper handling of the employee verification information can create problems in payroll compliance and employee morale as well as costly expenditures for error corrections and non compliance.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nWhile Form W-4 has only seven information lines, the information contained on the Form is critical to the payroll process. Failures at the employer end can lead to compliance and employee morale issues with regard to amounts withheld, timely processing, and incorrect information returns.\n\nEmployers may be held liable or penalized for incorrect withholding tax where the employer failed to solicit or timely process the forms or fails to withhold according the information provided on the forms.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\n  The legal requirement that the employer withhold income tax from employee compensation\n  Form W-4 line by line including the information to be included by the employee and entries that can cause the form to be invalid, the special instructions for nonresident aliens, state withholding certificates and certificates of non-residency, and effective dates for new and revised W-4 information  \n  When an employee must submit a new W-4 and when an employee may submit a new W-4 \n  Requirements for electronic W-4 Forms\n  How to deal with problems such as invalid or incorrectly prepared forms, name and Social Security Number mismatches, notices from the IRS or Social Security Administration, and lock in letters. The difference between invalid forms and questionable forms\n  When W-4 Forms must be sent to the IRS\n  The IRS matching process and how to use the Social Security Number Verification System and how to make verification part of the employer payroll taxes process\n  Penalties for failing to withhold or deposit tax and reporting errors\n  Establishing reasonable cause for avoidance of penalties and taking advantage of de minimis error exceptions to penalties \n  Record retention requirements \u2013 how long must an employer maintain the forms including successor employer requirements\n\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\n  Understand the employer\u2019s legal obligation to withhold tax\n  Know what must or must not be included on each line of Form W-4 and how to identify invalid Forms\n  Understand the importance of SSN verification and how to include it in the payroll process\n  Know how to deal with special problems and situations related to Form W-4 such as non-resident alien forms, lock in letters, and invalid and questionable employee submissions\n  Be aware of the penalties for non-compliance and how to mitigate or avoid the penalties by following due diligence procedures that establish reasonable cause \n  Know the record retention requirements for employee tax form\n  Be aware of the special requirements for electronic W-4 Forms\n  Be aware of state withholding certificate requirements\n\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\n  Payroll Supervisors and Personnel\n  Payroll Consultants\n  Payroll Service Providers\n  Public Accountants\n  Internal Auditors\n  Tax Compliance Officers\n  Enrolled Agents\n  Employee Benefits Administrators\n  Officers and Managers with Payroll or Tax Compliance Oversight\n  Company / Business Owners\n  Managers/ Supervisors\n  Public Agency Managers\n  Audit and Compliance Personnel / Risk Managers\n\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nFor more information, please visit :  https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/b...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nPatrick A Haggerty\n\nPat Haggerty is a tax practitioner, author, and educator.
