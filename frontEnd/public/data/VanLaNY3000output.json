Well never fear, because Random Access Theatre is happy to announce that we will be presenting the next SIX MONTH run of DRUNK RESTORATION COMEDY!\n\nStarting FRIDAY, MARCH 3RD, we're back, taking over The Player's Theatre Loft on the first Friday of each month at 10PM for some more uproarious old-fashioned fun. In case you missed the first edition back in September here's how it goes down. The premise: our team of brave (or just crazy?) artistic associate actors will perform a reading of a restoration comedy. The catch: they'll be doing so while heavily under the influence. Even better, this interactive evening will give audience members a chance to choose their own adventure and dictate which performers get totally sloshed and which are sent packing. Anything could happen, come find out what does!\n\nTickets are only $12 and include a complimentary drink*- beer, wine, or craft cocktail, which means one less drink that YOU have to purchase for the fun drinking games we have up our sleeve! Buy your tickets online here, we can't wait to spend our Friday nights getting drunk and doing theatre with you!\n\nLine up of shows:\n\n\n\tMarch: SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL\n\tApril: TBA\n\tMay: TBA\n\tJune: TBA\n\tJuly: TBA\n\tAugust: TBA\n\t\n\t*Fear not - there's plenty of liquid courage to go around.

While maintaining the integrity and hallmark passion of the genre, Belgo-Colombian Annabelle Lopez Ochoa imagines an original and explosive movement language premised upon the theme of communication between the sexes and performed to an original guitar composition by Eric Vaarzon Morel.\n\n\n\nFlabbergast (2001)\n\nChoreography by Gustavo Ram\u00edrez Sansano\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nLatin lounge meets spontaneous combustion in this quirky yet joyful piece set to the music of Juan Garc\u00eda Esquivel. Inspired by his experience of coming to America for the first time, choreographer Gustavo Ram\u00edrez Sansano exposes with humor our stereotypes and preconceived ideas about new and foreign places. Flabbergast is dedicated to the choreographer's mother, who taught him how to dance the bay\u00f3n.\n\n\n\nClub Havana (2000)\n\nChoreography by Pedro Ruiz\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nA portrait of the glamorous Havana of the 1950s during the heyday of Cuban music, dance and nightlife. The intoxicating rhythms of the conga, rumba, mambo, and cha cha are brought to life by choreographer Pedro Ruiz, a native of Cuba, in this re-imagined nightclub filled with the exhilarating sounds, colors and ambience of that golden era.\n\n\n\nAsuka (2011)\n\nChoreography by Eduardo Vilaro\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nAsuka is a celebration of the music of Celia Cruz through the lens of the Latino experience. Cruz, renowned as the \"Queen of Salsa,\" captured the heart of Latinos the world over and became a symbol of perseverance for many. Through rich imagery and humor, Eduardo Vilaro explores the struggles of departure from one\u2019s homeland and the exuberance of success experienced by a community.\n\n\n\nAbout Ballet Hisp\u00e1nico:\nAmerica\u2019s premier Latino dance organization for more than 45 years, Ballet Hisp\u00e1nico brings communities together to celebrate and explore Latino cultures and the shared human experience through dance. Founded by National Medal of Arts recipient Tina Ramirez, Ballet Hisp\u00e1nico has been led since 2009 by Artistic Director &amp; CEO Eduardo Vilaro, who has infused the organization\u2019s legacy with a bold and eclectic brand of contemporary dance that reflects America\u2019s changing cultural landscape. Through performances of its internationally-acclaimed Company, innovative dance training programs, and community education activities that inspire individuals of all ages and backgrounds, Ballet Hisp\u00e1nico brings the joy of dance and Hispanic culture to the world.\n\n\n\n",

Ask about our discount pricing for U.S. military veterans.\nLIKE us on Facebook: www.Facebook.com/NYSafetyandTraining\n\nVisit our website: www.NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings mandates that all workers at major construction sites must have had the OSHA 10-hour Construction Industry safety class within the last five years. DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. \nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n",

        "description": "The Economics of Streaming\u2026and the \u2018value gap\u2019\nConsumption of streaming music, media and entertainment is exploding around the world. Free, ad-supported music services are reaching millions of users who want to listen to what they want, when they want. Since the creation of the first paid subscription services 15 years ago, the labels have considered on-demand access to be consumption - not promotion - eventually competing with and replacing the lucrative sales model their businesses were built on.\n\nToday the largest music service in the world is YouTube, with 1billion monthly active users. Over 58% of Internet users in the U.S. have a YouTube account. Facebook has 1.71bn monthly active users (with more than 1bn daily active users on mobile); Twitter has 320mm, and Spotify has 100mm. Contrast these user numbers withthe paying subscriber numbers of Apple Music, now at over 20 million subscribers, and Spotify with 40 million paying subscribers.\n\nYouTube stars are garnering vast audiences and enviable revenue, while music artists and the music industry are increasingly frustrated that they are not receiving comparable value for the use of their music and compositions. They argue that YouTube isn\u2019t a revenue generator commensurate with its user base. New consumption patterns and a specific video and YouTube culture have emerged, which in conjunction with the existing Safe Harbor legislation, is changing the relationship between fan, star and revenue-generation\n\nSiding with the record industry over the amount of money YouTube pays to artists and labels Andrus Ansip, VP for the Digital Single Market at the European Commission, estimates that YouTube now contributes $679m a year to music rights-holders, despite its billion-plus monthly audience, while Spotify alone delivers $1.8bn.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last twelve months, YouTube has paid out over $1 billion to the music industry from advertising alone. Unlike the audio streaming services, YouTube won\u2019t commit to pay minimum guarantees based on users and usage, but it will share ad income with music rights owners, meaning that income to the music industry goes up as more ads are sold, not more videos streamed.\n\nWhat are the economics of streaming \u2013 for the service providers, the rightsholders, the artists and the users?\n\nIf ad-supported and subscription services are increasingly competing head-on, should free services be paying the same percentage of their income to rights holders as paid subscription services? What is the impact of the DMCA Safe Harbor provision on revenue for rights holders?\n\nWhat changes in legislation, licensing and contracts will guarantee a marketplace where the two different business models - free, ad-supported and paid-for subscription - can be made to work \u201cfairly\u201d with increased revenues returned to artists and rightsholders?\n\nMusic 4.5 The Economics of Streaming will examine the economics and business models of streaming, the latest developments around music licensing, the implications of digital service providers different business models, legislative reform, as well as the impact of the ad-market dynamics on per-stream rates for artists, record labels, publishers, and collective rights management organizations.\n\nWe will cover questions such as:\n\n\n\tHow can the \u2018free model\u2019 be made to work better and more fairly for artists? \n\tWill the review of safe harbor legislation deliver a level playing field between ad-supported and subscription-based service providers, e.g. Spotify and YouTube? \n\tWill \u2018take down\u2019 also mean \u2018stay down\u2019? What are the issues with \u2018stay down?\u2019 How accurate is YouTube\u2019s Content ID?\n\tHow to grow the pie by opening up for additional royalties collection? What are the additional but currently neglected and untapped revenue streams, e.g. performance royalties for terrestrial radio? \n\tEveryone mentions YouTube, but how about the other big platform and social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, which are increasingly focused on video content delivery? Will they also rely on the DMCA Safe Harbor for user-uploaded content, or will they negotiate agreements with labels and publishers? What is the potential impact for artists and the music business? \n\tHow do artists, rightsholders, and users navigate multi-territory licensing? \n\tIs it the government\u2019s role to legislate rates to guarantee a competitive marketplace? \n\nIf consumption is free, what is the value of promotion?\n",

By the end of the three hour class Participants are proficient in Manual Mode settings taking more successful photographs. Each Composition in the Field class begins with a brief introduction with Participants take walking instruction through one of a variety of photogenic locales (determined prior to the class). Participants put to practice the workshops lesson during this three-hour session. During the class, students learn and apply new concepts like panning and depth of field. Another skill is the understanding of the correct use of selective focus to add another dimension to their photos... literally. Much of the time, depth of field is used to accentuate beautiful natural scenes. Another creative use is in Portrait Photography where the focus is only on the eyes. It can be used in any situation to create a more interesting and complex image. For these strategies, I give instruction on both the fundamental mechanics of the technique and ways to apply it to improve the everyday photograph. Throughout the workshop lessons the participants are given exercises to increase their \u201cArt of Seeing Through the Lens\u201d as well as ways to look at the composition of their images by gaining an understanding of the transition of seeing from a multidimensional world to the camera. Images captured in the camera are expressed to the viewer in 2 dimensions length and width.The Art of Seeing covers techniques to create illusions of space, making the right lens choices, camera angles and light modifying effects. With my over 25 years of experience as a photography, printer and professional photographer I will guide the Participants through each step of the process in a fun three-hour session. Over the entire workshop series they will learn to shoot strategically, getting more interesting photos and come away with a foundation to improve their photographs in the future, whether for work and or pleasure.",

        "description": "Overview:\n\nIn this webinar, I will discuss the importance of being ready for a Notice of Inspection (NOI) - also referred to as audit by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), what happens when an ICE audit occurs, and an employer\u2019s potential liability for I-9 errors discovered by ICE in the audit. The webinar will discuss the need for preventive maintenance \u2013 an employer performing an internal I-9 audit - which should discover many of the I-9 errors and correct them, if possible. We will discuss what happens if an employer is chosen for an ICE audit. There are certain steps that the audit will take \u2013production of existing I-9 forms, after remediating as many errors as possible (though sometimes ICE will not accept remediation performed after ICE delivers the NOI), assertion of legal arguments on why any alleged errors are not I-9 violations, negotiating with ICE on a reduction of the proposed penalty, and litigation before OCAHO, if the negotiations are unsuccessful.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nIn the new Trump administration, it is anticipated that ICE will crackdown on undocumented workers. One way to do this is to conduct more I-9 inspections by ICE and even detaining undocumented workers for possible deportation. Second, the penalty for I-9 violations and employment of undocumented workers has recently greatly increased; thus, the penalties for these violations is going to be much higher. Currently, it is not uncommon for employers to receive penalties of over $100,000. Thus, there is plenty to fear about ICE inspections in a Trump administration.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nThis webinar will cover a number of areas, including: internal I-9 audits; ICE audits; what is a substantive violation; what is a technical violation; why is the difference between the two types of violations important; how should an employer respond to an ICE audit; how should I-9 errors be corrected or remediated; and potential consequences and penalties from an ICE audit.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nThe objectives of the webinar are to demonstrate the necessity of internal I-9 audits, how to correct I-9 errors, how to respond to an ICE audit; how to prevent significant liability from an ICE audit; and the need for legal counsel throughout the ICE audit.\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nHR Professionals\n\nCompliance Officers\n\nPayroll staff\n\nIn\u2013house counsel\n\nOwners\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nBruce E. Buchanan is a partner at Sebelist Buchanan Law PLLC with offices in Nashville and Atlanta, where he primarily represents employers in all aspects of immigration law, with a special emphasis on employer immigration compliance, as well as employment law matters. Mr. Buchanan received his law degree from the Vanderbilt University School of Law in 1982. He served as senior trial specialist for the National Labor Relations Board for 20 years.

        "description": "In this digital photography workshop we explore the fascinating area and the unique ethnic community of Manhattan: Spanish Harlem. Participants learn the tips and hints for successful \"street photography.\" At the same time acquiring the knowledge of the camera basic, the various functions and camera settings to gain greater control. By the end of the three hour class Participants are proficient in Manual Mode settings taking more successful photographs. Each Composition in the Field class begins with a brief introduction with Participants take walking instruction through one of a variety of photogenic locales (determined prior to the class). Participants put to practice the workshops lesson during this three-hour session. During the class, students learn and apply new concepts like panning and depth of field. Another skill is the understanding of the correct use of selective focus to add another dimension to their photos... literally. Much of the time, depth of field is used to accentuate beautiful natural scenes. Another creative use is in Portrait Photography where the focus is only on the eyes. It can be used in any situation to create a more interesting and complex image. For these strategies, I give instruction on both the fundamental mechanics of the technique and ways to apply it to improve the everyday photograph. Throughout the workshop lessons the participants are given exercises to increase their \u201cArt of Seeing Through the Lens\u201d as well as ways to look at the composition of their images by gaining an understanding of the transition of seeing from a multidimensional world to the camera. Images captured in the camera are expressed to the viewer in 2 dimensions length and width.The Art of Seeing covers techniques to create illusions of space, making the right lens choices, camera angles and light modifying effects. With my over 25 years of experience as a photography, printer and professional photographer I will guide the Participants through each step of the process in a fun three-hour session. Over the entire workshop series they will learn to shoot strategically, getting more interesting photos and come away with a foundation to improve their photographs in the future, whether for work and or pleasure.",

        "description": "Key Take Away:\n\nThis webinar is designed to address how the impact of Multiple Free Trade Agreements will influence the merchant\u2019s duty rates and their resources allocation, production, and trade patterns by focusing on the duty management roles when it relates to the importer in understanding how to reduce taxes and tariff costs in the geopolitical international trading environment.\n\nOverview:\n\nManufacturing in Mexico as a Maquiladora under the IMMEX program (formally known as the Maquiladora Program) can offer tremendous benefits for virtually any foreign manufacturer, especially those selling into the North American market (North American free trade agreement certificate of origin).\n\nEstablished in 1965 by the Mexican government to reduce unemployment along the borders, the Maquiladora program offers foreign companies easy access to inexpensive labor, favorable tax benefits and special import/export terms via some 44 free trade treaties and agreements with countries around the world. The IMMEX program, however, requires companies to follow strict regulations and compliance, especially in the areas of Customs (Import/Export) and Accounting. A strong administrative team is highly recommended.\n\nMexico's IMMEX program is defined as an instrument to temporarily import goods and services that will be manufactured, transformed, or repaired, and then re-exported without payment of taxes, compensatory quotas, and other specific benefits. In the past there used to be two separate programs in Mexico; Pitex for 'temporary' imports and exports, and the Maquila program for maquila-specific operations. The new IMMEX program consolidates the benefits of these legacy programs and facilitates interaction with government authorities to operate under the program.\n\nThe main benefit of the IMMEX program is the ability to defer taxes on goods that are temporarily imported into Mexico and the ability to consolidate import declarations. Mexico's IMMEX program is defined as an instrument to temporarily import goods and services that will be manufactured, transformed, or repaired, and then re-exported without payment of taxes, compensatory quotas, and other specific benefits. Recently Mexico Prohibited Use of U.S. Re-Export Sugar in IMMEX Program.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nThe Mexican Maquiladora/PYTEX programs have evolved over the past 60 plus years into today's IMMEX (IndustriaManufacturera, Maquiladora y Servicios de Exportacion) program. It allows qualifying companies a greater range of activities they can take part within the Mexican territory.\n\nGiven its temporary imports under bond options, this program has a rigorous documentation maintenance requirement. It will review this special regime's bonded production/assembly options, how you can best take advantage of it and how to maintain it.\n\nAs importers or exporters, we must learn how to manage costs attributed to duties that can be imposed by the customs authority of the transactional region. In doing so, importers and exporters must not only rely on the customs authorities to inform them about the duty management requirements for each trade agreement that might alert them to allowances that applied to their business goods.\n\nThis trade agreement review process will explain the merchants\u2019 responsibility in understanding and use the various duty management options in compliance with multilateral trade agreements. For this reason, the duty management role in the reviewing and assessing the trade barriers that are associated with quotas, nontariff, punitive damages and special duties that were designed by the country of origin to restrict trade and increase coordination costs for their benefits. Thus, it is imperative that merchants have agood understanding of trade agreements and duty compliance processes, which can lead to legal and coordination challenges that might cause in delaying their product entire into the marketplace.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nBrief history\n\nMaquiladora formation and regulations\n\nIMMEX registration requirements\n\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement Certificate of Origin Form\n\nCombining IMMEX and NAFTA\n\nAnnex 24 &amp; 31- IMMEX\n\nEligible operations\n\nBenefits\n\nProgram cancellations\n\nMexican FTAs\n\nGain awareness for the regime\n\nUnderstand its requirements\n\nRecognize the program's benefits\n\nDistinguish the program's obstacles and resource requirements\n\nBe aware of the penalties and program cancellations\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nAim of the IMMEX program\n\nWho is eligible to obtain an IMMEX program\n\nHow to manage an IMMEX program\n\nNon-tariffs measures application\n\nIMMEX obligations\n\nDifference between IMMEX and other Export promotion programs\n\nHow the FTA's affected the application of import tariffs to IMMEX importations\n\nCustoms Value on IMMEX operations\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nCFOs\n\nTrade and Finance Controllers\n\nLogistics Professionals\n\nPlant Managers\n\nSupply Chain Professionals\n\nSourcing Specialists\n\nShipping/Receiving Staff\n\nProcurement Analysts\n\nGlobal Trade Managers\n\nIntegration Managers\n\nRisk Management Managers\n\nDecision Makers\n\nFor more information, please visit : http://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/cr...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nDr. Rossano V.

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nThis entrepreneurial development program webinar will address how to regain that \u201ceye of the tiger\u201d to leverage the strength and growth of our successes with the start-up mentality that we started with.\n\nOverview :\n\nThe spirit of entrepreneurialism flourishes in small companies and start-ups but tends to be choked out in larger organizations. Is this a fact that we live with or do we challenge it? How do we learn how to bring the agility of these smaller groups into the established structure of bigger companies?\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nWe start companies and we use entrepreneurship development programs to fuel their growth. We add people and processes and complexity and more growth. Then we look back and see what our organizations have become and we don\u2019t recognize them. At least, we don\u2019t recognize the culture that used to so entrepreneurial and has now evolved into a structured, bureaucratic entity.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nRichard Mills provides proven methods for keeping the entrepreneurial spirit from small organizations into the larger structures of big companies that would otherwise be focused on more proven methodologies.\n\nThings that negatively affect creativity, entrepreneurialism and innovation exist everywhere but they take on different characteristics in larger organizations. It is the success that makes companies large and prosperous that can create counter cultures against the very attributes that got it where they are today.\n\nAs a society, we admire the agility and urgency of a start-up; we love a great success story about the \u201clittle guy\u2019s\u201d solution to a problem and the corresponding consumer acceptance to this solution. However, when we look at the resources (manpower, finances, expertise) of larger companies, there should be no reason that the same success stories cannot also be seen for any size.\n\nSome large organizations are very successful with continuing their roots of entrepreneurialism but what about the others? Let\u2019s learn from the repeated agility of the small and the proven foundations of the large.\n\nThe difference between small and large organizations will be explored as it affects entrepreneurialism. This includes: motivation, urgency, agility and focus on the \u201cdrive side\u201d. The support structure is examined in terms of team diversity, skill resources, financing and management oversight. Once success is achieved, what are the effects of customer loyalty, market penetration and distribution networks? And what about the actual decision making process itself? How does this differ and how can it be optimized?\n\nOverall goal alignment and team alignment can bring the freshness of a start-up into any organization even a Fortune 500 company.\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nCreate an environment for entrepreneurial creativity regardless of the size of your organization\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nOperations Managers and Directors\n\nEngineering Managers and Directors\n\nSales Managers and Directors\n\nHR Professionals\n\nLine Managers\n\nChief Human Resource Officers\n\nHR Directors and Managers\n\nTraining Directors\n\nExecutive Team Members\n\nBusiness Owners\n\nFor more information, please visit : https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/h...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nRichard Mills\n\nRichard is an executive leader with business growth experience including C-suite leadership, business unit management, strategic vision, financial planning, team development and recruiting.

While certain errors in reporting dollar amounts are considered \u201cinconsequential\u201d under new de minimis error rules, errors in the payee name or TIN are never considered inconsequential and can result in penalties.\n\nBest practices to avoid errors and penalties include TIN solicitation, TIN verification, timely and appropriate response to IRS notices including issuing and follow up on B-Notices to payees, and procedures to implement and discontinue backup withholding  as required.\n\nThe webinar will discuss the solicitation process including solicitation using and analyzing Form W-9, annual solicitations, B-notices and solicitations in response to IRS notices, and what to do when the vendor does not provide a TIN or provides an incorrect TIN.\n\nIt will cover how to register to use the IRS TIN verification service, how the system matches names and numbers and how this can help in preparing submissions to prevent false positive or negative responses from the system. It will cover how to submit TINs for verification and what to do when the system indicates a mismatch between the name and number of the vendor.\n\nProcedures related to IRS notification of a name number mismatch or propose penalties for incorrect information returns are also covered including procedures the payer must follow in issuing B-Notices to payees.\n\nAnd, the session will discuss establishment of procedures for proper administration of backup withholding.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nYear end is a busy time for Accounts Payable. With the acceleration of the due date for certain 1099 Forms and the increased penalties, it is more important than ever to prepare information returns correctly and file them on time.\n\nEstablishment and implementation of procedures providing for TIN solicitation, TIN verification, response to IRS notices and backup withholding are keys to efficient processing, avoiding errors or missing information, and establishing reasonable cause for penalty avoidance when errors occur.\n\nThis webinar discusses how to establish procedures and best practices, including name/TIN verification, that avoid situations that can lead to penalties or, when such situations occur, establish the reasonable cause defence that allows you to avoid the penalty.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nThis webinar will discuss\n\nThe IRS matching process\n\nHow the IRS matches the names and tax ID numbers on information returns such as Form 1099 to determine if they are correct. It also uses this process to notify issuers of incorrect names and numbers and to propose and assess penalties for errors to issuers.\n\nUnderstanding the process and registering for and using the IRS TIN verification service is a best practice for preventing mismatches and penalties and to establish reasonable cause when mismatches occur.\n\nPenalties\n\nPenalties for errors on information returns, including 1099 Forms have increased for 2016 returns filed in 2017.\n\nEstablishing reasonable cause\n\nWhen errors do occur, certain exceptions are allowed to the assessment of penalties including reasonable cause. To establish reasonable cause, issuers must demonstrate due diligence and circumstances beyond the issuer\u2019s control. Using Form W-9 to timely solicit information from a payee regarding the name and ID number of the payee, whether the payee is subject to or exempt from backup withholding, and the payee\u2019s entity type is a key first step in establishing due diligence. Additional follow up may be required when a payee fails to provide a TIN, when TIN verification returns a mismatch, or when the IRS notifies the issuer of an incorrect TIN.\n\nSolicitations\n\nSolicitations are the key to establishing due diligence and reasonable cause. The webinar will discuss how and when to make solicitations and what to do if the payee responds or fails to respond.\n\n TIN verification\n\nThe discussion will cover the registration process for the IRS TIN verification system, how to use the system to verify the matching of vendor names and TINs  are provided by the vendors, and the procedures to follow in a mismatch is returned.\n\n Notices\n\nWhat constitutes notice from the IRS that a vendor TIN is incorrect and what step should be taken after receiving a notice.\n\nBackup withholding\n\nBackup withholding is defined. When to begin backup withholding, when to stop backup withholding, how to deposit it and how to report it.\n\nYour Questions\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nKnow how to register individuals to use the IRS TIN verification system and set up a company account.\n\nKnow how to submit names and TINS for verification.\n\nKnow the steps to properly follow up on a mismatch indicated by the TIN verification system.\n\nUnderstand the importance of TIN solicitation using Form W-9 and follow up solicitations where necessary in establishing due diligence and reasonable cause for purposes of penalty avoidance.\n\nKnow how and when to issue B-notices to vendors and what to do when the payee responds or fails to respond.\n\nKnow what to do when a payee fails to provide a TIN.\n\nUnderstand backup withholding, when to start it, when to stop it, and how to deposit and report it.\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nCFOs and controllers\n\nAccounts payable and accounting managers\n\nAccounts payable processing professionals\n\nEmployers and Business owners\n\nPurchasing managers and professionals\n\nPublic accountants, CPAs and Enrolled Agents\n\nFor more information, please visit : https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/b...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nPatrick A Haggerty\n\nPat Haggerty is a tax practitioner, author, and educator.

Participants learn the tips and hints for successful \"location photography\u201d  &amp; close up macro photography.\" At the same time acquiring the knowledge of the camera basic, the various functions and camera settings to gain greater control. By the end of the three hour class Participants are proficient in Manual Mode settings taking more successful photographs. Each Composition in the Field class begins with a brief introduction with Participants take walking instruction through one of a variety of photogenic locales (determined prior to the class). Participants put to practice the workshops lesson during this three-hour session. During the class, students learn and apply new concepts like panning and depth of field. Another skill is the understanding of the correct use of selective focus to add another dimension to their photos... literally. Much of the time, depth of field is used to accentuate beautiful natural scenes. Another creative use is in Portrait Photography where the focus is only on the eyes. It can be used in any situation to create a more interesting and complex image. For these strategies, I give instruction on both the fundamental mechanics of the technique and ways to apply it to improve the everyday photograph. Throughout the workshop lessons the participants are given exercises to increase their \u201cArt of Seeing Through the Lens\u201d as well as ways to look at the composition of their images by gaining an understanding of the transition of seeing from a multidimensional world to the camera. Images captured in the camera are expressed to the viewer in 2 dimensions length and width.The Art of Seeing covers techniques to create illusions of space, making the right lens choices, camera angles and light modifying effects. With my over 25 years of experience as a photography, printer and professional photographer I will guide the Participants through each step of the process in a fun three-hour session. Over the entire workshop series they will learn to shoot strategically, getting more interesting photos and come away with a foundation to improve their photographs in the future, whether for work and or pleasure.

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nThis webinar will show how a risk manual can be developed and used, to design, perform, monitor and communicate business risk management.\n\nOverview :\n\nCommunicating about corporate risk management, enterprise risk management, and compliance, is never easy. It is done more easily, however, when the communications relate to what people do, and what is expected of them. What is expected of them can be communicated as the goals for what they do, and can be compared to the results of what they have done. And, both the results and the goals can best be seen as the end products of their work. Those end products are the outcomes \u2013 the results \u2013 of their assigned work \u2013 of their participation in the assigned enterprise risk management framework.\n\nAlthough companies often organize policies, procedures, plans and controls by organization components and subject matter \u2013 by function \u2013 organizing information and communication by business process enables lower costs, more focus, and greater accountability, among other benefits. When business processes are the focus, then the emphasis on communication, risk management and control can be on the outputs of those business processes; and, in turn, those outputs are the focus of risk management (basically, the purpose of risk management is to eliminate or mitigate unacceptable levels of uncertainty in the outputs of business processes due to factors affecting the outputs of business processes).\n\nEnterprise risk management training, to communicate efficiently and effectively throughout the organization about risk, a risk manual is a very useful tool. It enables presenting, by business process, the means of eliminating or mitigating risk in order to achieve acceptable levels of risk; and in doing so, enabling the integration of risk management program, control, and compliance.\n\nThis strategic management coursebegins with a review of a typical business process framework, which can be easily tailored to your organization, in the context of, and interacting with, outside related parties. These interactions are the bases for risk and compliance, and the organization\u2019s responses are the basis of control, so that business process framework enables defining the range of process outcomes, of process outputs, and whether these ranges are acceptable from the standpoint of both internal and external compliance, and internal control.\n\nThis webinar then will illustrate a risk manual and the tools for designing, using and communicating risk. These examples will show practical approaches that organizations have used successfully.In closing, recommended actions for measuring and monitoring an integrated approach to risk, control and compliance management will be presented.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nYou should attend if you are afraid of stakeholder reactions to the bad press from such matters as auditor comments about poor risk management and control, of regulator comments and ensuing actions due to compliance issues, and/or of unexpected performance problems due to failures to mitigate risks effectively, or failures to anticipate risks. Building monitoring into all business processes by using a risk manual, and having in place objective means of measuring and reporting on monitoring of risk, control and compliance can reduce the concerns about exposures to bad press.\n\nBeyond bad press are the fears and uncertainties of internal disharmony due to the inability of cross-functional teams to get the results desired from their efforts to manage risk and compliance. Cross-functional teams are the approach used by many organizations to address these matters, but there is a better answer, deriving from a business-process approach to managing risk, control and compliance. This approach will be presented in this webinar.\n\nUncertainty is built into risk, because the consequences of the causes of risk are shaped by the possibility of future events and the conditions that result from them. Good risk management can mitigate this uncertainty, by incorporating effective measuring and monitoring -- and, of course, effective planning and communication (which also should be monitored) \u2013 into business processes.\n\nSome people feel that being able to measure the level of risk, control and compliance management is uncertain, and doubt that it can be done. However, if objective and relevant measures are applied to the outcomes \u2013 the outputs -- of business processes, then it is likely that these matters can be monitored, and reported, in a way that enable the organization to be more comfortable with its exposures to fears, uncertainties and doubts.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nThis webinar will begin by defining why a business-process focus enables better management and communication of risk, control and compliance.\n\nThe webinarthen will define what a business process is, and will present a business process frameworkthat comprises the general scope of any organization by its component processes, activities and task; and then, for each activity, will identify its inputs, outputs, the controls and constraints on it, and the tools and mechanisms \u2013 including the performers themselves -- used to perform it, so that it provides an integrated view of work. That integrated view of the work can be documented in related policy and procedure, which should identify the who, what, why, where, when and how\u2014or said more completely, who does the work, how the work is done, why the work is done, where the work is done, when the work is done, and what \"the work\" is.\n\nThe webinar will present IDEF as a framework for each activity of a business process, as well as a composite framework for the overall set of business processes. For this, the webinar will present Michaels Porter\u2019s value chain of nine process sets \u2013 five in what he calls the value chain, and four process sets in what he identifies as infrastructure. From that, the webinar will use those nine process sets to dig down, through several levels of specificity, to components of each process set, down to activities, in many cases. These activities and their flows -- the who, what where, when, why and how -- will be defined in general, in what is called the logical design -- and then can be tailored to the conditions of the specific enterprise -- in what is called the physical design -- and then can be connected to each other because the output of one activity can become the input to another activity, and it is that output where risk, control and measuring and monitoring can reside, where compliance management is. Relevant metrics -- key risk and control indicators \u2013 will be presented and examples of their use will be described.\n\nThe webinar will look more closely at how business processes can be defined and organized, to shape measuring, monitoring, communicating and managing.An organization has three types of related and reinforcing business processes: design processes for defining and directing what is to be done, execution processes for doing what is to be done, and monitoring processes \u2013 is for confirming that by doing \u201cit,\u201d the intended results are achieved.\n\nThis categorization of process types and the processes themselves can shape the table of contents for a risk manual dealing with measuring and monitoring.\n\nSuch a manual can help youto determine -- by applying the tools to the areas discussed -- that all of the components of an activity are appropriate, evident and consistent, and if they link well to the preceding and the following activities. In effect, this framework can establish the basis \u2013 the content -- for each page of the manual, actual examples of which will be sown and discussed.\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nLearn how to apply business-process design, measurement, communication and monitoring\n\nLearn business-process management \u2013 for risk, control and compliance management\n\nLearn why this approach is more effective and efficient than functional management\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nLeaders and Members of Cross-functional Teams dealing with Risk, Control and Compliance Management\n\nOperations Staff\n\nAccounting Personnel\n\nIT Staff\n\nAuditing Personnel\n\nLine Personnel\n\nFor more information, please visit : https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/c...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nMalcolm Schwartz\n\nUntil his recent retirement from PwC, Mr. Schwartz had been the partner responsible for the consumer products industry management consulting practice in its Eastern Region.

Our 70+ events a year in 30+ markets has helped discover some of today's most sought after record producers. This year we intend to take steps to do the same for the up and coming songwriters on 3.21.2017 in NYC with the iStandard 'iWrite' Songwriter Experience. With the shift in the music industry leaning towards shopping full songs and tracks with hooks, the songwriter is now (more than ever) an extremely valuable asset to producers when pitching records for major label and flim/tv placements. With 'iWrite' we are basically using the same format as we do with the iStandard Producer Showcase. Each writer will showcase 3 (60 second) song or tracks w/ hook snippets and will be verbally judged on 5 Core criteria (Originality, Quality, Marketability, Melody/Structure and Overall Potential) by grammy winning songwriters, music execs, publishers and various industry tastemakers. The winning songwriter with the highest score overall will win a prize package consisting of a Grammy winning producer studio session, Record label &amp; Publishing entity listening sessions &amp; meetings, Video consultations, interviews and much more.\n\nJudges Include\n\n\n\tArden \"Keyz\" Altino (Songwriter/Composer for Jay-Z, Justin Beiber, Keyshia Cole, etc)\n\tKasual Kas (Director of A&amp;R at Playbook/KWL Enterprises)\n\tBrian Johnston (Senior Director of A&amp;R at Atlantic Records)\n\nThe Event Is Powered by ASCAP\n\nSubmit to the iStandard 'iWrite' Songwriter Showcase here at http://istandardproducers.com/showcase_submit\n",

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nThis webinar will take you through Design Controls that manufacturers require to follow a sound process to develop a medical device, with the intent of improving the probability that the device will reach an acceptable level of efficacy and safety. It will cover all aspects of the Design Control process to prevent costly compliance/regulatory errors up to and including medical device recalls.\n\nOverview :\n\nDesign Controls are the processes used to design, develop, and manage medical devices that you manufacture. They are mandated by federal regulation however the regulations concerning design controls are vague in terms of the specific process steps required and the approaches that should be taken to achieve compliance should be developed.\n\nKnowing how the FDA both views and examines design controls is crucial to achieving compliance throughout the life of the medical devices you manufacture and is one of the most valuable compliance subject areas to explore.\n\nNoncompliance in design controls, which are consistently uncovered by the FDA during inspections and examinations, are concerned with the design control process that has been designed and applied and the documentation required to support each design control step.\n\nThe specific sections of the regulations that apply to design controls include CFR 21 Part 820 Quality System regulation found in Sec. 820.30 and Sec. 820.40. These sections of the regulation are extremely complex and difficult to apply particularly for companies that are new to the medical device field.\n\nThis webinar will explore how design controls should be designed to meet both the spirit and intent of the regulation and the needs of both the medical device itself and the organization.\n\nAlso covered briefly will be an explanation of the FDA\u2019s new guidance concerning Adaptive Designs for Medical Device Clinical Studies.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nThe number of medical device recalls over the past several years has almost doubled each year indicating that the FDA is increasingly looking at the medical device industry in general and how products are designed and managed in particular. Manufacturers are at significant compliance risk when their design control processes are flawed and are not carefully designed. Compliance risk has significant health and safety implications that medical device companies today can simply not ignore.\n\nIn of Adaptive Designs, an adaptive design process can significantly reduce resource requirements, reduce the time to study completion, and increase the potential for study success.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nAn overview of the design control guidance for design controls\n\nA \u201cdrill down\u201d through each step of the design control process\n\nAn explanation and differentiation between verification and validation\n\nThe Design Control Plan \u2013 its contents, functions, and uses\n\nThe design control life cycle process\n\nAn overview of Adaptive Design and the recently produced FDA guidance explaining it\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nDescribe the regulatory guidance concerning design controls\n\nExplain each step of the design control process\n\nDefine the iterative nature of the design control process and how\n\nDefine validation and verification\n\nExplain the importance of and differences between design inputs and outputs\n\nExplain how validation and verification is accomplished\n\nWhat is the design control plan?\n\nExplain where in the process design verification and validation occurs\n\nExplain the Life Cycle process and how it relates to design controls in general\n\nOverview the Guidance document for Adaptive Designs for medical Device Studies\n\nDefine Adaptive Design\n\nState the advantages and limitations of Adaptive Design\n\nExplain when adaptive designs should be chosen\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nQuality\n\nRegulatory\n\nCompliance\n\nR &amp; D\n\nDesign and Development\n\nManufacturing and Engineering\n\nAnyone involved in the Manufacture of Medical Devices that has had some exposure to the subject area and regulated environments\n\nFor more information, please visit : https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/l...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nCharles H.

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nThis webinar will discuss the function and requirements of Form W-4 and how the information it provides is critical to the payroll process as well as how to avoid problems and identify and correct problems such as invalid or improperly filled out forms and errors in processing. It will also discuss the proper handling of special situations and requirements such as employee taxation exemption from withholding and nonresident alien W-4 Forms.\n\nOverview :\n\nForm W-4 has just seven lines but it is a fundamental part of the payroll process. In addition to information concerning the amount to withhold for income tax, the W-4 provides the employer with documentation of due diligence in soliciting employee name, Social Security Number, and address information. It is critical for penalty mitigation in the event the information is incorrect.\n\nThe Form provides a basis to have the correct amount of tax for employee withholding, but if it is prepared incorrectly, the employee may be subject to penalties. While the employer is not responsible for assuring correctness of the employee\u2019s claims, the employer is responsible for due diligence with regard to invalid forms and withholding according to the employee instructions provided by the form.\n\nImproper handling of the employee verification information can create problems in payroll compliance and employee morale as well as costly expenditures for error corrections and non compliance.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nWhile Form W-4 has only seven information lines, the information contained on the Form is critical to the payroll process. Failures at the employer end can lead to compliance and employee morale issues with regard to amounts withheld, timely processing, and incorrect information returns.\n\nEmployers may be held liable or penalized for incorrect withholding tax where the employer failed to solicit or timely process the forms or fails to withhold according the information provided on the forms.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\n  The legal requirement that the employer withhold income tax from employee compensation\n  Form W-4 line by line including the information to be included by the employee and entries that can cause the form to be invalid, the special instructions for nonresident aliens, state withholding certificates and certificates of non-residency, and effective dates for new and revised W-4 information  \n  When an employee must submit a new W-4 and when an employee may submit a new W-4 \n  Requirements for electronic W-4 Forms\n  How to deal with problems such as invalid or incorrectly prepared forms, name and Social Security Number mismatches, notices from the IRS or Social Security Administration, and lock in letters. The difference between invalid forms and questionable forms\n  When W-4 Forms must be sent to the IRS\n  The IRS matching process and how to use the Social Security Number Verification System and how to make verification part of the employer payroll taxes process\n  Penalties for failing to withhold or deposit tax and reporting errors\n  Establishing reasonable cause for avoidance of penalties and taking advantage of de minimis error exceptions to penalties \n  Record retention requirements \u2013 how long must an employer maintain the forms including successor employer requirements\n\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\n  Understand the employer\u2019s legal obligation to withhold tax\n  Know what must or must not be included on each line of Form W-4 and how to identify invalid Forms\n  Understand the importance of SSN verification and how to include it in the payroll process\n  Know how to deal with special problems and situations related to Form W-4 such as non-resident alien forms, lock in letters, and invalid and questionable employee submissions\n  Be aware of the penalties for non-compliance and how to mitigate or avoid the penalties by following due diligence procedures that establish reasonable cause \n  Know the record retention requirements for employee tax form\n  Be aware of the special requirements for electronic W-4 Forms\n  Be aware of state withholding certificate requirements\n\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\n  Payroll Supervisors and Personnel\n  Payroll Consultants\n  Payroll Service Providers\n  Public Accountants\n  Internal Auditors\n  Tax Compliance Officers\n  Enrolled Agents\n  Employee Benefits Administrators\n  Officers and Managers with Payroll or Tax Compliance Oversight\n  Company / Business Owners\n  Managers/ Supervisors\n  Public Agency Managers\n  Audit and Compliance Personnel / Risk Managers\n\n\nLevel: \n\nIntermediate\n\nFor more information, please visit :  https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/b...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nPatrick A Haggerty\n\nPat Haggerty is a tax practitioner, author, and educator.

The OSHA 10 Construction class is required by New York City for any worker at a major construction site. Without this OSHA card, you cannot legally work at a site in any of the five boroughs.\nSchedule:\nTuesday and Wednesday, June 13 and 14\n10:00 AM - 4:00 PM\nPrice: $115 online registration, $130 at the door price\n\nLocation: 50 Broad Street, Suite 1402\nNew York, NY 10004\n(2, 3, 4, or 5 to Wall Street or J or Z to Broad Street)\n\n\n\n\nNew York Safety and Training, Inc. is a Veteran owned enterprise.Ask about our discount pricing for U.S. Veterans.\nLIKE us on Facebook: www.Facebook.com/NYSafetyandTraining\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings mandates that all workers at major construction sites must have had the OSHA 10-hour Construction Industry safety class within the last five years. DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry \u2013 Designated Training Topics\n\nThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\n\n\nMandatory - 7 hours\n\nIntroduction to OSHA \u2013 2 hours\n\nCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint.

Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction \u2013 at least 30 minutes\n\nIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment \u2013 30 minutes\n\nCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica \u2013 30 minutes\n\nCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\n\n\nElective - 2 hours\n\nThe instructor will teach two to four of the following topics:\n\nScaffold Hazard Awareness\n\nThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation Hazards\n\nExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard Introduction\n\nIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder Safety\n\nLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory Protection\n\nThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomics\n\nThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health Program\n\nThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour\n\nThere is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n\nFor more information about New York Safety and Training and our other safety classes, visit our website at\nwww.NYSafetyandTraining.com\nor contact Sharon O'Donnell at\n(718) 734-8400   or Sharon@NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\n",

Searching for something clever to call the show, Godfrey Townsend and his band came up with this play on words ... Clapton is GOD-frey. After hearing Godfrey jamming on some Cream tunes in a club one night, Eric Clapton's guitar tech, Lee Dickson commented to John Entwistle of The Who: \"This guy's got Clapton down better than Clapton!\" Townsend's mastery is so complete that Jack Bruce (bassist, vocalist, and songwriter of Cream), has been recruiting Townsend and his band to back him up for the better part of the last decade. Godfrey and his band have been performing to sold-out crowds at B.B. Kings Blues Club in New York City's Times Square with their tribute to Eric Clapton for the past 15 years. This tribute show is the longest-running successfully on-going show B.B.'s has ever had. Spanning four decades of Clapton's amazing career, Townsend and his band maintain a large repertoire of material, constantly adding and switching up songs from different eras for a fresh musical experience every time. This is not just another cover band - no tribute band look-a-like actors here. Townsend and his band of world-class musicians authentically capture the essence of a musical evening with Eric Clapton. What made Clapton unique? Rather than simply replicating the blues riffs he'd heard on record, Clapton incorporated the emotion of the original performances into his own style of playing, thus expanding the vocabulary of blues guitar. The only triple inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of both The Yardbirds and Cream and as a solo artist), Clapton continues to astonish and delight a vast spectrum of music lovers. \"At the age of 18 I didn't expect to live beyond 25, you know, and when I did I was very surprised...\" -Eric Clapton Godfrey Townsend >> Godfrey Townsend @ Facebook >> Godfrey Townsend @ Myspace >>",

        "description": "Key Take Away :\n\nDuring this webinar, strategies for remote monitoring will be discussed, including the review of data for trends, how to make the most of writing queries, and what \u201cred flags\u201d to look for that may indicate issues on site.\n\nOverview :\n\nAcross the industry, companies are striving to find ways to improve operational efficiencies. Currently, over 80% of site-based documentation today is still fully paper based, with both cost and risk consequences for the entire clinical trial process. Specific liabilities of a paper-based system include audit and inspection risk, reduced site productivity, manual reconciliation of TMF and site records, as well as the lack of visibility into site performance.\n\nStrategies for saving time and money, without compromising oversight and quality, are an ongoing challenge within the industry. In an age where technology is ever present from ordering medications online, consulting with a physician, and having \u201clive\u201d conversations in chat rooms about medical issues, the clinical research industry has been slow to maximize the use of technology.\n\nWhy Should You Attend :\n\nWith sponsors/CROs implementing the FDA\u2019s final guidance on a risk-based approach to monitoring, time on site is being reduced to one day visits and/or on-site visits are scheduled few and far between per monitoring plans. Better utilization of remote monitoring is critical to ensure sites are compliant and the data is accurate and consistent.\n\nAreas Covered In This Webinar :\n\nA variety of approaches can be used by sponsors to ensure monitoring obligations are fulfilled. Traditionally, this has involved on-site visits where monitors are required to check a high percentage of the data entered on the case report forms (CRF) against source, to ensure that the protocol is deployed correctly, and adverse events reported appropriately.\n\nThe size, complexity and number of clinical trials mean that complete on-site monitoring is becoming an ineffective, expensive and inefficient process. However, effective monitoring is critical for the protection of subjects and the integrity of the data produced, meaning that on-site monitoring is still required by regulation for critical study parameters.\n\nRemote monitoring is seen as an acceptable addition to the process. To use remote monitoring effectively, a risk assessment must be performed and included in the monitoring plan prior to the start of any clinical program and adapted as the program evolves.\n\nLearning Objectives :\n\nDescribe approaches and techniques for remote data review\n\nExplain techniques for query writing to ensure clear communication of issues\n\nImplement strategies to identify problem areas and how to maximize time on site following remote monitoring\n\nWho Will Benefit :\n\nClinical Research Associates,\n\nStudy Coordinators,\n\nProject Managers,\n\nCRA Managers,\n\nValidation specialists\n\nFor more information, please visit : https://www.atozcompliance.com/trainings-webinar/l...\n\nEmail: support@atozcompliance.com\n\nToll Free: +1- 844-414-1400\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5509\n\nLevel: \n\nBeginner\n\nSpeakers Profile :\n\nDanielle DeLucy\n\nDanielle DeLucy, MS, is an Independent Consultant to the Biologics and Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\nDanielle DeLucy, is owner of ASA Training and Consulting, LLC which provides Pharmaceutical and Biologics based companies with training and quality systems assistance in order to meet Regulatory compliance.\n\nPrior to this role, Danielle has been in the industry for 15 years serving in numerous Quality Management Roles, such as the Director of Product Quality, the oversight of Sterility Assurance practices and provided QA oversight of numerous filling and packaging operations.\n\nDanielle began her QA career as a Quality Control Pharmaceutical Microbiologist at a contract laboratory where she performed various tests for their clients. In the years after, she has held positions in the Quality management arena while increasing her responsibility. She has helped to lead many Regulatory Health Inspections and was instrumental in the coaching process of her peers prior to any inspection.\n\nCurrently, Danielle assists companies who are faced with warning letters, consent decrees and those wishing to improve compliance establish more robust quality systems so that the company can succeed.\n",

This is the most powerful of the risk management techniques because it considers risks in normal operation as well as fault conditions. FMEA and FTA consider only fault conditions and are more suited as reliability tools than as product safety tools.\n\nIn this ISO 14971 risk management training we will explain in detail the process of conducting a hazard analysis. The confusing terms \u201chazard\u201d, hazardous situation\u201d, \u201charm\u201d, \u201ccausative event\u201d, \u201cALARP\u201d, \u201crisk index\u201d, \u201cresidual risk\u201d will be explained. We will go step by step through a template for hazard analysis so that the process is clear. Examples of hazards and hazardous situations will be discussed. Also, how to deal with residual risk will be discussed. We will go step by step through a typical hazard analysis.\n\nWe will explain how to integrate Human Factors studies into the Hazard Analysis and how to integrate Hazard Analysis into the design program.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nFDA expects that as part of a product development program risk management will be conducted. FDA recommends using ISO 14971 as a guide and has accepted it as a recognized standard.

FUD symptoms include:\n\nNegative attitudes regarding the organization or its customers\n\nStrained relationships between employees and management\n\nUs versus them attitude\n\nPoor morale\n\nPolitical behavior\n\nOveractive rumor mill\n\nThese and many more are all symptoms of dysfunctional organizations and must be addressed.\n\nProcesses are an organizations competitive advantage; processes must be effective, efficient and exhibit very high reliability:\n\nEffectiveness \u2013 no rework in any process\n\nEfficiency \u2013 work is completed within or on schedule\n\nHigh reliability \u2013no \u201cweak-link\u201d in the chain of processes\n\nFear is very contagious; it moves from person to person throughout the organization.  Employees will do whatever it takes to survive; however, these actions may not result in the quality of work expected by management.\n\nThe Cost of FUD: ineffective, inefficient and unrealizable processes are costly to the organization.  The average performance of a company is 3-sigma, 25 percent to 40 percent of its revenue is wasted.  A 4-sigma company will lose 15 percent to 25 percent of revenue.\n\nProcess Reliability Modeling (PRM) can easily move an organization to 5-sigma if the issues found during PRM are addressed and a process owner monitors processes; the final result will be a very low FUD factor.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nProblem Definitions\n\nCost of Quality As a Percentage of Sales\n\nProcess Reliability Modeling\n\nThe Five Levels of Problems\n\nFailure Analysis\n\nRCFA or RCA\n\nIs the Problem Solved\n\nResults of Doing it Wrong\n\nModel for Improvement\n\nProcess are Competitive Advantage\n\nProcess for Gathering Evidence\n\nProcess Mapping\n\nPost-it Exercise Used to Gather Evidence\n\nSpies and Hackers: Protect Your Data\n\nIndustrial Espionage\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nTo enhance problem solving effectiveness by providing participants an advanced method for identifying multiple root causes and methods to solve problems.\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nSr. Management Team\n\nProcess Owners\n\nManagers\n\nSupervisors\n\nEmployees\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nDr. Michael Abitz is an Adjunct Professor at New Mexico Jr. College, Hobbs, NM.

Just as lean principles challenge traditional process concepts and \"push\" systems, many traditional document practices are artefacts of a flawed approach.  Lean documents presents a fresh departure from these practices, while building upon proven principles.   Lean configuration comes from the same principles, utilizing the unique power of software solutions to take over functions that had previously burdened controlled \"paper\" documents.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nMedical Device managers, engineers, QA personnel, as well as lean program leaders.\n\nDo you find yourself constantly struggling to create, manage, and maintain all of the information found in DHFs, DMRs, and DHRs - which is often redundant, repetitive, and chained together in a cumbersome way?  Do you find that your design and manufacturing resources are spending way too much time on documentation and not enough on engineering and design?  This webinar presents a fresh new approach based upon solid principles and proven practices - as well as an alternative that avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional ways of preparing these documents.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nBrief introduction to Lean Documents and Lean Configuration\n\nQuality System Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and ISO 13485 as it applies to DHF, DMR, and DHR\n\nDesign History Files (DHF) content, development, and management\n\nDevice Master Records (DMR) content, development, and management\n\nDevice History Record (DHR) content, development, and management\n\nApplying lean principles to creating, developing, and managing a DHF\n\nApplying lean principles to creating, developing, and managing a DMR\n\nApplying lean principles to creating, developing, and managing DHRs\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nBy attending this webinar, you will learn a fresh new approach based upon the solid principles and proven practices. This webinar will also present points that can avoid many pitfalls of traditional ways of preparing documents.\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nManagers, Supervisors, Directors, and Vice-Presidents in the areas of:\n\nR&amp;D\n\nManufacturing Engineering\n\nDesign Assurance\n\nQuality Assurance\n\nOperations\n\nDocument Control\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nJos\u00e9 Mora is a Principal Consultant specializing in Manufacturing Engineering and Quality Systems.

        "description": "Overview:\n\nProcess Reliability Modeling (PRM) examines organizations transactional, reliability engineering training or manufacturing processes to determine the likelihood of passing work through each process with errors resulting in costly rework and customer disaffection.\n\nReliability training courses of every process is accomplished by interviewing all employees by process throughout the organization. Qualitative information gained from interviews is analyzed using Cause and Effect Diagrams.\n\nFrom Cause and Effect Diagrams significant issues are identified and surveys created to collect quantitative data to determine probability of passing work through each process without rework.\n\nPRM is a very sensitive measurement tool to analyze the entire organization to reduce cost of doing business and increase customer\u2019s satisfaction.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nIn organizations where employees experience fear, uncertainty or doubt (FUD) production and quality of work will suffer resulting in loss of customers and revenue. FUD symptoms include:\n\nNegative attitudes regarding the organization or it\u2019s customers\n\nStrained relationships between employees and management\n\nUs versus them attitude\n\nPoor morale\n\nPolitical behavior\n\nOveractive rumor mill\n\nThese and many more are all symptoms of dysfunctional organizations and must be addressed.\n\nProcess reliability trainingsare an organizations competitive advantage; processes must be effective, efficient and exhibit very high reliabilitymodeling and prediction:\n\nEffectiveness \u2013 no rework in any process\n\nEfficiency \u2013 work is completed within or on schedule\n\nHigh reliability \u2013no \u201cweak-link\u201d in the chain of processes\n\nFear is very contagious; it moves from person to person throughout the organization. Employees will do whatever it takes to survive; however, these actions may not result in the quality of work expected by management.\n\nProcess Reliability Modeling starts with employees who analyze their organization to determine issues, bottlenecks that inhibitwork progress. From the analysis Process Owners are selected and work begins on improvement to ensure effective, efficient and reliable processes.\n\nThe Cost of FUD: ineffective, inefficient and unrealizable processes are costly to the organization. The average performance of a company is 3-sigma, 25 percent to 40 percent of its revenue is wasted. A 4-sigma company will loose 15 percent to 25 percent of revenue.\n\nProcess Reliability Modeling (PRM) can easily move an organization to 5-sigma if the issues found during PRM are addressed and a process owner monitors processes; the final result will be a very low FUD factor.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nThe Organization as a System\n\nThe Affects of One Bad Process on the System\n\nHow an Ineffective Process is Identified Before It Affects Organization\u2019s Bottom Line\n\nProcess Improvements that Lasts\n\nThe Role of Process Owners\n\nManagement Support\n\nImproving Bottom Line Without Layoffs\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nAddress Problems with Countermeasures\n\nCollect Process Information from Employees\n\nPrioritize the Information for Analysis\n\nTurn Qualitative Information into Quantitative Data\n\nCompute Reliability of Each Process from Quantitative Data\n\nDetermine Cost of Unreliable Processes\n\nDetermine the Correct Course of Corrective Action\n\nEngage Corrective Action\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nSenior Management Team\n\nProcess Owners\n\nManagers\n\nSupervisors\n\nEmployees\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nDr. Michael Abitz is an Adjunct Professor at New Mexico Jr. College, Hobbs, NM.

        "description": "Overview:\n\nHow are we supposed to keep it all straight when there are times when the legal requirements of both FMLA and the ADAAA are similar, yet at other times one law contradicts another?  We find that we can\u2019t comply with both laws at the same time, so which one takes precedence over the other?\n\nAnd where does WC come in?  To complicate matters even more, WC is a state law, while FMLA and ADAAA are federal laws, and there are other state civil rights laws that also impact FMLA and the ADAAA.  Consider that an injury under WC may also be a \u201cserious health condition\u201d under FMLA. State laws may differ from federal laws by covering additional health conditions, may apply to small organizations, or may cover situations in which the federal laws have no say such as domestic abuse.\n\nAs HR, we have the responsibility of sifting through these laws to ensure that we comply with each law that provides the best benefit to our employees. These laws provide entitlements to our employees which means they are not considered an optional benefit.\n\nSo, even if you fail to apply the law to your employee,   they can claim protection anyway. For example, if you fail to provide appropriate leave under FMLA, that does not remove the employee\u2019s right to a job-protected leave.  The ultimate goal of all three laws is to assist the employee to return to work.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nEnsuring compliance with FMLA can be frustrating for many HR professionals who are uncomfortable with the Act.  This leads to litigation.  Then, to add the ADAAA legal requirements adds to the confusion which can also lead to discrimination under civil rights law.  Sometimes sprinkled in with FMLA and the ADAAA is WC \u2013 the nexus among the three legal requirements, especially as it relates to leave, medical certification, and getting the employee back to work as quickly as possible, can be daunting.  This ADAAA and FMLA training for HR professionals will separate the three laws and examine how each law applies to work situations.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nThis webinar by speaker Dr. Susan Strauss will discuss financial-costs related to absenteeism, turnover, liability based on civil rights laws, and costs related to investigations.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nTo review the intricacies of  how WC, ADAAA, and WC intersect to provide employees\u2019 coverage under these acts\n\nTo discuss the challenges in terminating an employee after they have expended their FMLA benefits without ignoring their rights through the ADAAA or state laws and ensuring workers compensation compliance\n\nTo identify steps to follow when an employee fails to provide the requested and required medical certification\n\nTo explain the process in responding to an intermittent leave request that may include a potential ADAAA accommodation\n\nTo describe essential documentation guidelines to prevent liability\n\nTo outline best practices when conducting the legally required interactive process when determining an accommodation\n\nTo clarify a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities based on the ADAAA\n\nTo discuss the criteria for essential job functions\n\nTo determine if and why you need a second or third medical opinion\n\nTo judge WC/ADAAA light duty restrictions while  keeping FMLA intermittent and reduced scheduled leave viable\n\nTo identify the top ten FMLA leave mistakes\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nThe webinar addresses laws that HR is responsible for upholding.  When the laws are not followed, it increases the liability for the organization and interferes with a fair and equitable work environment for employees.  The interplay among Workers\u2019 Comp, ADA, and FMLA is confusing to many HR professionals, this webinar will help decipher the complexities.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nDr. Susan Strauss RN Ed.D., has worked as a registered nurse (RN) in a variety of nursing specialties. She has also been the director of healthcare quality improvement, director of education and development, and held other healthcare leadership roles.\n\nOne of Dr. Strauss\u2019s areas of expertise is with bullying and harassment in healthcare- working as an expert witness for lawsuits, training, and conducting investigations. She researched physician abuse to RNs in the OR to determine if the abuse varied based on the gender of the nurse.\n\nDr. Strauss has authored over 30 books, book chapters, and articles, and has been featured on local, national and international media. Susan has conducted seminars and consulted with organizations, including healthcare, globally.\n\nFor more detail please click on this below link:\n\nhttps://complianceglobal.us/product/700651/DrSusan...\n\nEmail: referrals@complianceglobal.us\n\nToll Free: +1-844-746-4244\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5515\n\nFax: +1-516-900-5510\n",

        "description": "Overview:\n\nInvestigators must obtain information to investigate.  Often, the objective of an interview is to obtain an acknowledgement of something that is known to the interviewer; an admission of involvement in a matter under investigation, or a confession to being the perpetrator of a crime or serious violation.  It is imperative that the interviewer obtains truthful information from an interviewee in a lawful and ethical manner.\n\nThe interviewer must be aware of current laws and regulations that govern interviews.  The interviewer must also be aware of current trends and negative public opinion regarding interviewer tactics used to elicit information from an interviewee, even if the information is truthful.  Truthful information that has been elicited by coercion or force can be invalidated and the interviewer can face serious consequences.  The interviewer should be thinking forensically in that he or she must be prepared to articulate to a tribunal the method used to obtain information, including admissions and confessions from an interviewee.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nIf you conduct or supervise investigations, you need to be aware of the current laws and regulations that govern interviews in the public or private sector.  In addition, you should be aware of specific rules that govern interviewing union employees.\n\nThis webinar will explore best interview practices in the search for truth, whether it is from witnesses, information providers, or suspects.  You will learn how to avoid creating an interview environment that could subject you and your company to lawsuits or criminal sanctions for false imprisonment, assault, or obtaining a false confession.\n\nBy learning and following the guidelines and practices discussed in this webinar you will enhance your reputation as a professional interviewer.

Environmental monitoring is the method by which clean rooms are known to maintain a certain level of cleanliness. The methods by which clean rooms are monitored are through viable and non-viable testing.  Through this testing, a room may demonstrate that it is out of control.  This seminar will provide aspects to investigate in order to determine a root cause and appropriate actions to complete the report.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nRegulatory agencies review environmental monitoring programs to determine how well a facility is in a state of control.  Excursions related to environmental monitoring are crucial in demonstrating this to an auditor.  Investigations as results of environmental monitoring must be thorough and have the proper corrective actions put into place.  The purpose of this webinar is to demonstrate how to conduct a thorough investigation and determine the proper actions to take as a result of the investigation.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nTopics covered include:\n\nInternational regulations (ISO)\n\nFederal regulation (FDA, USP)\n\nNon-viable testing\n\nViable testing\n\nIdentification of microorganisms\n\nPossible sources\n\nDetermination of a root cause\n\nCorrective and Preventative actions to put into place\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nEnvironmental monitoring of clean rooms is a key component in demonstrating a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility is in a state of control.  However, when environmental monitoring excursions occur, it can prove something within the system is amiss.  By having a through environmental monitoring investigation, root causes and corrective actions can be put into place to demonstrate the facility is under control.  This webinar will give an understanding of environmental monitoring, approaches to resolving excursions, and putting the proper corrective and preventative actions into place to reduce future excursions.\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nAll personnel who work for pharmaceutical manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations where environmental monitoring is done.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nCarl Patterson, M.S. has completed twelve (13) plus years in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and quality fields.

        "description": "Overview:\n\nWe hopefully learn from our mistakes. But, it is far better to learn from other people\u2019s errors and avoid them in the first place. In nearly 40 years of R&amp;D in the pharmaceutical industry, I\u2019ve made--and seen-- some doozies\u2014 technical errors, miscommunications, strategic planning oversights, and quite a few \u201cpolitical\u201d blunders. Many, if not all, were preventable. All were costly! For example, over a multi-year period, our manufacturing plant had an occasional release-assay failure, for commercial heparin in intravenous bags.  The plant did not consider it a serious problem because re-testing, with a larger sample size, nearly always was successful; the problem was attributed to assay-error and most of those lots were released. Suddenly, every batch failed.  It was only then, that the Manufacturing Group got our R&amp;D involved.  What we discovered made my jaw drop: Over the preceding five years, each batch contained a few units with low, or no, heparin. Could this life-threatening error have been prevented? Clearly, many mistakes that derail projects and commercial products are avoidable. In this presentation, we\u2019ll be discussing my experience with critical errors, and how you can avoid falling into the same traps.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nThis presentation will focus on the speaker\u2019s negative experiences, in the belief that, through recognition of mistakes and their underlying causes, similar errors can be avoided. Even the brightest and most experienced pharmaceutical scientists and administrators make mistakes. Seemingly minor errors in judgment, communication, planning, technology, or personal interactions may lead to costly catastrophes: Important and expensive projects and programs may be terminated, costly joint ventures can go amuck, personal interactions may become strained, products could be recalled, and the company\u2019s reputation can be tarnished.  Worst of all, patients may be injured or die from a subtle mistake, such as substituting a \u201cless expensive\u201d filter on a commercial batch of drug or, speeding up an assembly line to \u201cimprove\u201d productivity. Lawsuits, of course, may follow. Through case histories, Dr. Marsh will demonstrate the critical importance of anticipating potential errors, providing clear and multi-way communication, and fostering a spirit of cooperation between all facets of R&amp;D and, between R&amp;D and other groups, including pilot plant, manufacturing, marketing groups, administrators, and venture partners. If just one product is saved from failure, or a single life spared, this webinar will be of tremendous value to you and your company.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nThis session will examine multiple case histories, where seemingly small errors led to serious problems, like the aforesaid example of a manufacturing plant making a money-saving change that resulted in the release of life-threatening intravenous units of heparin, containing low, or no, drug.\n\nDiscussion points: What went wrong? Why must the lesson learned be applied to all pharmaceutical R&amp;D/manufacturing plant interactions?\n\nAn expensive joint venture was contracted between Dr. Marsh\u2019s ophthalmic drug delivery group and a small company, which had successfully brought a sub-dermal drug delivery implant to the U.S. market. The initial objective was to have the partner prepare a tiny version of their marketed device, using an ophthalmic drug. Over several months, the partner consistently showed data supporting zero-order release. However, about eight months into the program, it was discovered that the partner\u2019s work was fatally flawed; the program was halted and the project was terminated.\n\nDiscussion points: Could this failure have been anticipated and prevented? Does this same error show up in other drug delivery literature/patents?\n\nA little more than a decade ago, Dr. Marsh\u2019s group developed a novel drug delivery drug-device combination, designed to heat and injects a low-melting formulation into the eye, where it solidified into a sustained-release depot. The prototype injector, which was built in his lab, was modified and scaled up for mass manufacture, by his company\u2019s Engineering Department. The politics/egos surrounding a single failed lot [1 in 35 lots] scuttled the entire program.\n\nDiscussion point: How might \u201ccooler heads\u201d have prevailed and saved this innovative drug-device program?\n\nThe transfer of a novel contact lens cleaning product from Dr. Marsh\u2019s group to the pilot plant went amuck. The heat-sensitive enzyme in the formulation became denatured. The Director of the pilot plant\u2014a smart and trustworthy individual\u2014insisted that each failed batch was held well-below denaturization temperature and, indeed, the thermocouple documentation supported his position.\n\nDiscussion points: What went wrong with scale-up? How was the problem identified and corrected? How might the lessons learned be applied to other R&amp;D to Pilot Plant formulation transfers?\n\nOther examples and analysis of critical R&amp;D formulation/drug delivery errors will be presented, as time permits.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nLearn, from the errors of others, how one might minimize or avoid:\n\nTechnical errors\n\nMiscommunications\n\nStrategic planning oversights\n\nPolitical blunders\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nPharmaceutical R&amp;D scientists, pilot and manufacturing personnel, and their administrators.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nDr. Marsh is a highly- accomplished pharmaceutical scientist with a solid reputation for innovation, research management, and CMC team leadership. He is experienced in collaborating and coordinating projects with Marketing, Manufacturing, Pilot Plants, PK, Toxicology, Analytical Chemistry, Packaging and other Functions. He has extensive knowledge of drug delivery, medical device development, ICH guidelines, and FDA regulations and is a globally-recognized Ph.D. with numerous international patents/patent applications, 55+ published papers, and a solid network of contacts within the scientific community. He\u2019s familiar with, and proponent of, Quality by Design (QbD).\n\nFor more detail please click on this below link:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2ljWSBZ\n\nEmail: referrals@complianceglobal.us\n\nToll Free: +1-844-746-4244\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5515\n\nFax: +1-516-900-5510\n",

That\u2019s not the case.\n\nAs Peter Drucker, the founder of modern management said, \u201cCulture eats strategy for lunch.\u201d Changing culture in the workplace is one of the most important business drivers that must be intentionally set and periodically adjusted to push long-term, sustainable success. It's not good enough just to have an amazing product and a healthy bank balance. The workplace culture can enable company culture ideas, or be the key to its undoing.\n\nWhat about your corporate culture change examples? Does it inspire and engage or get in your people\u2019s way, slowing and wearing them down? Is it driven from top-down directives or cross-department collaboration? What stories do employee engagement survey tell about you? This webinar will show how to change your organization culture.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nHow to improve organizational culture and ideas to improve company culture are hot topics among businesses who want to attract the best talent, translate their values to their products and services, and show customers what they're all about. There are significant benefits that come from a vibrant and impactful culture. They are:\n\nFocus and Spirit: Aligns the entire company towards achieving its vision, mission, and goals\n\nEngagement: Builds higher employee motivation, productivity, and innovative problem solving\n\nCohesion: Builds consistency and coordination among the company\u2019s various departments and divisions\n\nAlso,importance of organizational cultureoften becomes the focus of attention during periods of organizational change. Mergers and acquisitions, new systems implementations and elaborate initiatives typically fail because organizations become caught in the so-called \"jaws of culture\u201d - when the existing culture becomes inappropriate, and improving workplace culturesupports progress.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nLearn why Peter Drucker says: \u201cCulture eats strategy for lunch\u201d\n\nDiscover why culture is like an iceberg: What\u2019s above and below the water line\n\nIdentify and analyse the six key elements of culture in every business or organization\n\nReview twelve daily ways effective leaders can communicate and reinforce company culture\n\nReview leadership and organizational culture\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nPlan specific actions you will take to lead or influence changes in the culture of your organization\n\nUse a three step process to pinpoint what drives organizational culture change managementof your team, department or company\n\nUnderstand what successful leaders know and do that helps them avoid organizational culture management traps and mis-fires\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nCEO\u2019s\n\nCOO\u2019s\n\nVP of Human Resources\n\nChief Learning Officers\n\nDirectors\n\nProject Managers\n\nOperation Managers and Supervisors\n\nTeam Leaders\n\nHuman Resources Professionals\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nMarcia Zidle is board certified executive coach based in Dallas Texas.

        "description": "Overview:\n\nISO 9001:2015's new clause for \"actions to address risks and opportunities\" is among the biggest revisions to the standard. Risks and opportunities that relate to waste or muda, and also to changes in technology, markets, and distribution channels are however not explicitly covered, and are therefore not explicitly auditable, even under the new standard.\n\nThis credit risk mitigation presentation will therefore focus on use of the standard as a servant whose purpose is to promote the organization's competitiveness and profitability, rather than a master whose requirements the organization has to satisfy to get the ISO certificate. ISO 9001 becomes the servant when the organization uses it as a framework to drive continual improvement and to identify risks and opportunities that lie well beyond the scope of the standard.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nISO 9001:2015 requires \"actions to address risks and opportunities\" (clause 6.1) with regard to (1) the context of the organization (clause 4.1) and needs and expectations of interested parties (clause 4.2).  The failure of Kodak's world-class and ISO 9001 registered photographic film division shows, however, that mere conformance to the standard is not adequate to ensure profitability or even survival.\n\nThe standard also has no explicit requirement to address any of the Toyota production system's Seven Wastes, except of course for poor quality. The other six wastes (muda) can however be far more costly than poor quality. They are also asymptomatic (without symptoms) so, unlike poor quality, they rarely announce their presence. The organization must seek them out systematically to achieve optimum results. The good news is that, once the organization has identified the waste, it is relatively easy to adapt existing corrective and preventive action (CAPA) processes to remove it.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nISO 9001:2015 tells us what we must do with regard to \"actions to address risks and opportunities.\" The scope of this clause includes the context of the organization, and needs and expectations of interested parties. This presentation will however focus not on what we have to do to meet the standard's basic requirements, but on what we ought to do to achieve sustained world-class performance.\n\nISO 9001 originated from a military specification for quality assurance requirements, and it has focused historically on quality. The scope of risks and opportunities includes, however, not only quality (only one of the TPS Seven Wastes) but also waste or muda, supply chain risks, and external risks and opportunities from new technology and new product distribution channels. As an example of the latter, the countries that controlled the western end of the Silk Road in the 15th century had a great moneymaking monopoly on trade from the Far East\u2014until Vasco da Gama ruined their day by circumnavigating Africa. The Internet is doing something similar to many brick and mortar enterprises today. The digital photography that Kodak helped invent rendered the company's world class photographic film almost entirely obsolete.\n\nGeneral Carl von Clausewitz's term \"friction\" meanwhile applies squarely to many forms of internally controllable waste or muda. Friction means simply everyday annoyances that force people to correct or work around seemingly minor problems, but ultimately degrade the organization's performance. Awareness of friction is a prerequisite for its removal.\n\nRisk is meanwhile the consequences of an undesirable occurrence times its probability. Probability (or frequency) involves, however, not just the chance of an individual occurrence\u2014the focus of the occurrence rating in failure mode effects analysis (FMEA)\u2014but also the frequency of exposure to the risk. The concept that risk = np rather than just p, where p is the chance of an individual occurrence and n the number of exposures, leads in turn to the principle that only engineering controls (error-proofing, poka-yoke) countermeasures can ensure that the problem never occurs. The Army's Risk Management process makes it clear that engineering controls are superior to administrative controls that rely on worker vigilance for effectiveness.\n\nThe supply chain is an enormous source of risk because interruption of purchased goods will render even the leanest and best-quality factory unable to produce anything. A reliable supply chain is, in fact, a prerequisite for just in time control systems that carry little or no protective inventory. Henry Ford, whose logistics system was compared to a \"continent-spanning conveyor\" (Norwood, 1931. Ford: Men and Methods), pointed this out explicitly in My Life and Work (1922).\n\nOrganizations can also create their own risks as shown by Mylan's price hikes on its Epi-Pen epinephrine injector. It was only a matter of time until competitors stepped in to offer generic alternatives.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nISO 9001 originated to address quality risks in complex organizations with handoffs between processes over which no individual person had total control.\n\nISO 9001 has focused heavily on risks associated with poor quality, but not on other forms of waste or muda that can easily be far more costly than poor quality. Poor quality makes its presence known very quickly if it is not prevented, and it often is, by planning for quality through, for example, FMEA.\n\n\"Risk = np and not just p.\" This principle is straight from the Army's Risk Management Process, which recognizes that risk is not just the chance of an individual occurrence (p), but also the number of times (n) we are exposed to it. This requires engineering controls, error-proofing, or poka-yoke to make the undesirable occurrence impossible (p=0) because, if p&gt;0, the problem will eventually occur if we are exposed to the risk enough times. (The application here is primarily to quality and safety.)\n\nThe Army's Risk Management Process is a free (public domain, publication of the U.S. Government) off the shelf resource on risk management. It encompasses most if not all the provisions of ISO 31000:2009.\n\nIt is vital to address supply chain risks, as well as risks associated with changing technology and distribution channels, regardless of whether ISO 9001:2015 requires explicit consideration of these matters. (Clause 4.1 could however be construed in this manner, as it requires the organization to consider \"internal and external issues\" that could affect its ability to \"achieve the intended result(s) of its quality management system.\")\n\nThe Epi-Pen controversy underscores the risks associated with raising prices to the point where competitors will step in to follow the advice of the Mob Museum in Las Vegas: \"Give the people what they want.\" Changes of this nature often encourage or even compel innovation by competitors and other stakeholders.\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nAll management, noting that ISO 9001:2015 is explicitly the responsibility of the management team rather than a management representative. Quality and manufacturing engineers and technicians also may benefit from some of the principles for identifying risks and opportunities.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nWilliam A. Levinson, P.E., is the principal of Levinson Productivity Systems, P.C. He is an ASQ Fellow, Certified Quality Engineer, Quality Auditor, Quality Manager, Reliability Engineer, and Six Sigma Black Belt.\n\nHe is also the author of several books on quality, productivity, and management, of which the most recent is The Expanded and Annotated My Life and Work: Henry Ford's Universal Code for World-Class Success.\n\nFor more detail please click on this below link:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2lyCXii\n\nEmail: referrals@complianceglobal.us\n\nToll Free: +1-844-746-4244\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5515\n\nFax: +1-516-900-5510\n",

        "description": "Overview:\n\nWe hopefully learn from our mistakes. But, it is far better to learn from other people\u2019s errors and avoid them in the first place. In nearly 40 years of R&amp;D in the pharmaceutical industry, I\u2019ve made--and seen-- some doozies\u2014 technical errors, miscommunications, strategic planning oversights, and quite a few \u201cpolitical\u201d blunders. Many, if not all, were preventable. All were costly! For example, over a multi-year period, our manufacturing plant had an occasional release-assay failure, for commercial heparin in intravenous bags.  The plant did not consider it a serious problem because re-testing, with a larger sample size, nearly always was successful; the problem was attributed to assay-error and most of those lots were released. Suddenly, every batch failed.  It was only then, that the Manufacturing Group got our R&amp;D involved.  What we discovered made my jaw drop: Over the preceding five years, each batch contained a few units with low, or no, heparin. Could this life-threatening error have been prevented? Clearly, many mistakes that derail projects and commercial products are avoidable. In this presentation, we\u2019ll be discussing my experience with critical errors, and how you can avoid falling into the same traps.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nThis presentation will focus on the speaker\u2019s negative experiences, in the belief that, through recognition of mistakes and their underlying causes, similar errors can be avoided. Even the brightest and most experienced pharmaceutical scientists and administrators make mistakes. Seemingly minor errors in judgment, communication, planning, technology, or personal interactions may lead to costly catastrophes: Important and expensive projects and programs may be terminated, costly joint ventures can go amuck, personal interactions may become strained, products could be recalled, and the company\u2019s reputation can be tarnished.  Worst of all, patients may be injured or die from a subtle mistake, such as substituting a \u201cless expensive\u201d filter on a commercial batch of drug or, speeding up an assembly line to \u201cimprove\u201d productivity. Lawsuits, of course, may follow. Through case histories, Dr. Marsh will demonstrate the critical importance of anticipating potential errors, providing clear and multi-way communication, and fostering a spirit of cooperation between all facets of R&amp;D and, between R&amp;D and other groups, including pilot plant, manufacturing, marketing groups, administrators, and venture partners. If just one product is saved from failure, or a single life spared, this webinar will be of tremendous value to you and your company.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nThis session will examine multiple case histories, where seemingly small errors led to serious problems, like the aforesaid example of a manufacturing plant making a money-saving change that resulted in the release of life-threatening intravenous units of heparin, containing low, or no, drug.\n\nDiscussion points: What went wrong? Why must the lesson learned be applied to all pharmaceutical R&amp;D/manufacturing plant interactions?\n\nAn expensive joint venture was contracted between Dr. Marsh\u2019s ophthalmic drug delivery group and a small company, which had successfully brought a sub-dermal drug delivery implant to the U.S. market. The initial objective was to have the partner prepare a tiny version of their marketed device, using an ophthalmic drug. Over several months, the partner consistently showed data supporting zero-order release. However, about eight months into the program, it was discovered that the partner\u2019s work was fatally flawed; the program was halted and the project was terminated.\n\nDiscussion points: Could this failure have been anticipated and prevented? Does this same error show up in other drug delivery literature/patents?\n\nA little more than a decade ago, Dr. Marsh\u2019s group developed a novel drug delivery drug-device combination, designed to heat and injects a low-melting formulation into the eye, where it solidified into a sustained-release depot. The prototype injector, which was built in his lab, was modified and scaled up for mass manufacture, by his company\u2019s Engineering Department. The politics/egos surrounding a single failed lot [1 in 35 lots] scuttled the entire program.\n\nDiscussion point: How might \u201ccooler heads\u201d have prevailed and saved this innovative drug-device program?\n\nThe transfer of a novel contact lens cleaning product from Dr. Marsh\u2019s group to the pilot plant went amuck. The heat-sensitive enzyme in the formulation became denatured. The Director of the pilot plant\u2014a smart and trustworthy individual\u2014insisted that each failed batch was held well-below denaturization temperature and, indeed, the thermocouple documentation supported his position.\n\nDiscussion points: What went wrong with scale-up? How was the problem identified and corrected? How might the lessons learned be applied to other R&amp;D to Pilot Plant formulation transfers?\n\nOther examples and analysis of critical R&amp;D formulation/drug delivery errors will be presented, as time permits.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nLearn, from the errors of others, how one might minimize or avoid:\n\nTechnical errors\n\nMiscommunications\n\nStrategic planning oversights\n\nPolitical blunders\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nPharmaceutical R&amp;D scientists, pilot and manufacturing personnel, and their administrators.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nDr. Marsh is a highly- accomplished pharmaceutical scientist with a solid reputation for innovation, research management, and CMC team leadership. He is experienced in collaborating and coordinating projects with Marketing, Manufacturing, Pilot Plants, PK, Toxicology, Analytical Chemistry, Packaging and other Functions. He has extensive knowledge of drug delivery, medical device development, ICH guidelines, and FDA regulations and is a globally-recognized Ph.D. with numerous international patents/patent applications, 55+ published papers, and a solid network of contacts within the scientific community. He\u2019s familiar with, and proponent of, Quality by Design (QbD).\n\nHis core strengths include: research and innovation, ophthalmic drug delivery, formulation development, collaborative research, interdisciplinary team leadership, GLP research and GMP development, risk assessment, analytical and organic chemistry, sterilization techniques and 3-P oriented planning.\n\nFor more detail please click on this below link:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/2ljWSBZ\n\nEmail: referrals@complianceglobal.us\n\nToll Free: +1-844-746-4244\n\nTel: +1-516-900-5515\n\nFax: +1-516-900-5510\n",

        "description": "Overview:\n\nNearly nine out of 10 family physicians say they would use telehealth to assist in treating their patients if they were compensated for it, according to a survey conducted by the Robert Graham Center for Anthem, Inc. and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Telemedicine is a $27 dollar billion industry set to grow to more than $34 billion dollars by 2020. By next year millions of new members will have access to covered telemedicine services by commercial payers. This growing line of business creates opportunities that require coders to be ready to code these services confidently, navigate the associated rules and reimbursement issues, and understand the emerging procedures associated with telemedicine. This one hour conference provides the listener with these coding insights and more!\n\nThe question that I get almost all of the time is \"Can I bill for that and be paid\"?  My response:  It depends!  I think that we need to explore Telemedicine and the answer if we are documenting appropriately.  We must be compliant in our billing efforts.\n\nWhy Should You Attend:\n\nCoders and Billers will need to know these imperative new focus shifts that will enhance our ability to focus our care on the patient. With the fact that we are facing a shortage of physicians, Telemedicine is providing a means of seeing patients from a distance.\n\nAreas Covered in this Webinar:\n\nAlso answering the question if insurance allows for these services.  Discussion about the modifier that must be appended.  How does the insurance company know that these were Telemedicine services?\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nProvide telemedicine training programs, an educational foot print for Telemedicine and the direction in which we are headed in the future.\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\nEveryone will benefit especially the patient\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nRhonda Granja is a certified professional coder and certified medical assistant.

During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album \"Addiction\" in 2014. \n\nThey decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to \"Dubstep\" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album \"Hybrid Distillery\" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director \"Ebola - Delit2fuite\" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.\nwww.GanjaWhiteNight.com\nwww.soundcloud.com/GanjaWhiteNight\nwww.facebook.com/GanjaWhiteNight\n\nwith support from Boogie T.\n\n\n\n18+\nDoors @ 7PM\n\nCoda\n1712 Walnut Street, Philadelphia\nPhone: (267) 639-4630\nwww.codaphilly.com",

Advance tickets are on sale now!\n\nAbout PRINCESS MONONOKE: Based on Japanese folklore, Princess Mononoke is a landmark of animation and a film of unsurpassed power and beauty. An epic story of conflict between humans, gods, and nature by Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle), the film has been universally acclaimed by critics and broke the box office record on its original release in Japan. While defending his remote mountain village from a demonic boar-god, the young warrior Ashitaka (voice of Y\u00f4ji Matsuda) becomes afflicted with a curse that grants him superhuman power in battle but will eventually take his life. Traveling west to find a cure or meet his destiny, he journeys deep into sacred depths of the Great Forest where he meets San, the Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a girl raised by wolf-gods who is waging battle against the human outpost of Iron Town, on the edge of the forest. The Princess is a force of nature, with blood-smeared lips, riding bareback on a great white wolf. She draws young Ashitaka into the struggle between man and nature, forcing him to try to find another way\u2014one that will halt the endless circle of killing and create a middle ground where forest creatures and humans can live in the world in peace together.

The band's unique sound has allowed it to endure for nearly three decades and appeal to fans, young and old, all over the world.\n\nWhen The English Beat (known simply as The Beat in their native England) rushed on to the music scene in 1979, it was a time of massive social and political unrest and economic and musical upheaval. This set the stage for a period of unbridled musical creativity, and thanks in large part to the Punk movement and it's DIY approach to making music, artists like The Beat were able to speak out and speak their mind on the news of the day, as in \u201cStand Down Margaret\u201d, things that mattered to them and the youth culture, as in \u201cGet A Job\u201d, and universal matters of the heart and soul, as in their classic hits \u201cI Confess\u201d and \u201cSave It For Later\u201d.\n\nThe original band consisted of singer-songwriter Dave Wakeling on vocals and guitar, Andy Cox on guitar, David Steele on bass, and Everett Morton on drums \u2013 later additions Ranking Roger (toasting) and foundational First Wave Ska legend Saxa (saxophone) completed the outfit. The band crossed over fluidly between soul, reggae, pop and punk, and from these disparate pieces they created an infectious dance rhythm.\n\nThe Beat first came to prominence as founding members of the British Two Tone Ska movement, with their classic first album \u201cJust Can't Stop It\u201d fitting squarely in that genre. Along with their contemporaries The Specials, The Selecter, and Madness, the band became an overnight sensation and one of the most popular and influential bands of that movement.\n\nHowever, band leader Dave Wakeling never felt constrained by the movement. Dave has always viewed ska as a springboard, not a straight jacket. Indeed, the band's sound continued to evolve over their first three studio albums, through the General Public era (a band formed by Dave with Ranking Roger, the toaster from The Beat), and has continued it's evolution with the forthcoming English Beat album \u201cHere We Go Love\u201d, a PledgeMusic crowd-funded album set for release in 2016, the band's first new album since 1982's \u201cSpecial Beat Service\u201d.\n\nConsummate showman that he is, Dave Wakeling has continued to keep The Beat alive and strong. Dave continues to tour the world as The English Beat with an amazing all-star ska backing band playing all the hits of The Beat, General Public, and songs from his new album \u201cHere We Go Love\u201d. You just can\u2019t stop The English Beat!",

It has been building and maintaining momentum since its creator, Martin Vogt, returned to the U.S. from Austria in 2008.\n\nVogt\u2019s primary tool for composition is piano improvisation; it provides the foundation for his work and the core of his musical identity. Having spent endless hours in the studio \u2014 and upwards of fourteen years studying piano performance \u2014 Martin has honed his craft into the professional sound it is known for today, characterized by exciting, progressive tracks which are crafted with unique composition and seamless design.\n\nIn 2014, Martin made major leaps with his highly acclaimed \u201cTwo Fold, Pt.1\u201d LP, followed subsequently by a modern rendition of \u201cSmooth Criminal\u201d which immediately achieved viral popularity, and succeeded in astounding music critics across the board. After earning the admiration and respect of some of the biggest acts in the industry, Haywyre went on to tour the nation with the likes of Gramatik and Mat Zo.\n\nWith 2015 on the horizon, Haywyre has already made strong impressions after a highly successful Two Fold Tour. The nine date tour marked Martin\u2019s first solo tour which spawned rave reviews from fans and critics alike- a marker of what the promising future holds for Martin. \n\nHaywyre continues his mission to provide his listeners with music that not only presents variety and originality, but also carries the essence of a narrative. As one of Monstercat\u2019s most promising young talents, Haywyre is bound to impress the world with his instrumental dexterity and production capabilities.\n\nIf Martin Vogt aka Haywyre hasn\u2019t shown up on your radar yet, then let us introduce you to electronic music\u2019s newest Boy Wonder.\n-Vibe\n\nHaywyre has made a statement, loud and clear, that he is somebody who will take innovation by it\u2019s devilish horns and wrestle it into submission. He has distinguished himself as more than just a producer; he\u2019s a storytelling savant with musical abilities whose umbra blankets the dance music scene almost entirely.\n-YourEDM\n\nMany artists in today\u2019s electronic music scene are talented DJs as well as producers, crossing and mixing genres to create unique sounds. Newcomer Haywyre offers that and more: his sound is a blend of modern electronic music with classical and jazz music traditions. Add the use of performance videos and live instruments in that mix and you have a truly unique, musical force to be reckoned with.\n-UKF\n\nHaywyre has been piquing the interest of the music world with productions that marry his deep-seated jazz roots and years of formal piano study to the newer, ever-expanding field of electronic music, resulting in intriguing compositions that mark high in craftsmanship as well as innovation.\n-inthemix\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 The OPIUO Band \u2022\u2022\u2022\nwww.soundcloud.com/OPIUO\nwww.facebook.com/OPIUO\n\nEver wanted some extra funk in your life?

        "description": "Trinity Presbyterian Church in Berwyn, PA continues their successful Spotlight Concert Series on Saturday, March 25th at 7 PM with an In-The-Round featuring Craig Bickhardt, Thom Schuyler, and Jack Sundrud.  These three veteran performing songwriters are from the original Bluebird Cafe writers-in-the-round series that the hit TV series, Nashville, is based upon.  The creative sparks that fly between Thom, Craig and Jack during their writing sessions glow even more brightly on the stage.  The three of them have a knack for unreeling vignettes and painting miniatures within a pop song structure, displaying a keen eye for the telling lyric detail.  Join us in the sanctuary for one special evening of great acoustic music by three highly-acclaimed singer-songwriters.  You\u2019ll laugh a lot, cry a little and really be inspired!\n\nCraig Bickhardt is a folk/Americana performing songwriter with major writing credits, a poet\u2019s voice, a virtuoso guitar style and a veteran\u2019s experience.  He is the uniting force behind this critically-acclaimed In-The-Round series at venues throughout the country.  Craig composed three # 1 Billboard hits and nine top-10 ten hits, and has shared the stage with Bruce Springsteen, Stephen Stills, Judy Collins, Hank Williams Jr., Kathy Mattea, and others.  Craig's songs have found their way onto platinum and Grammy-winning recordings by legends such as Johnny Cash, Martina McBride, Willie Nelson, Ray Charles, B.B. King, Kathy Mattea and Alison Krauss. His voice and songs can be heard in the Academy Award-winning film Tender Mercies, starring Robert Duvall, as well as the films Switchback and At Close Range.  Website:  www.craigbickhardt.com\n\nBethlehem native Thom Schuyler\u2019s performing style reflects his early folk influences including Dylan, John Prine and Loudon Wainwright.  His literary lyrical sense and storytelling skills shine in songs like \"My Old Yellow Car\" and \"Sixteenth Avenue,\" the unofficial anthem of Music Row's songwriting community.  Thom was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2011.  His songs have been recorded by more than 200 artists including The Forester Sisters, Michael Martin Murphy, The Judds, and Barbara Mandrell.  His song \"Love Will Turn You Around\" (Kenny Rogers) was ASCAP Song of the Year in 1982, and American Music Awards Song of the Year in 1983.\n\nIn addition to being members of the original \"Writers In The Round\" at Nashville's famed Bluebird Cafe back in the mid-1980s, Craig and Thom were two thirds of the hit Nashville trio SKB, which also included songwriter Fred Knobloch.  SKB had several charting records, one of which was the Schuyler-Bickhardt classic \"This Old House\", a top twenty radio hit and number one video for two consecutive weeks on CMT.  In 1994 Craig and Thom also collaborated as songwriters, producers and singers on the critically acclaimed CD \"Precious Child\" released on Warner Brothers Records.  Their long history and close friendship make for an entertaining combination whenever they share the stage. Website: www.thomschuyler.com\n\nJack Sundrud cracked the charts with Great Plains (Sony Records) and now plays bass in the pioneering country rock group Poco, whose 40-year roster reads like a Who's Who in the genre.  He has toured as bassist/vocalist with Vince Gill, Dickie Betts, Bobby Whitlock, Kathy Mattea.  Sundrud has released two critically-acclaimed solo CDs, and his songs have been recorded by Kenny Rogers, The Judds, The Persuasions, Michael Johnson, and many more.\n\nTogether, Bickhardt and Sundrud have written over 100 songs, including the number one Billboard hit for Ty Herndon, \"It Must Be Love\".  They've also collaborated on numerous songs that have been recorded by seminal country-rock band Poco and the group Great Plains.  Their song \"Father's Day\" has become a popular viral video on YouTube and is featured on the Poco CD, The Wildwood Sessions.  Craig and Jack regularly collaborate and record together under the nom de plume \"Idlewheel\".  Idlewheel's CD \"Live At Morningstar\" was recently rated four stars by reviewer Nick Cristiano in the Philadelphia Inquirer.  He stated \"easy humor and tight, soulful harmonies are the trademarks of this outstanding duo.\"  Website: www.jacksundrud.com\n\nThe dynamic chemistry between Craig, Thom and Jack is the result of many years of friendship, collaboration and performing together. You will be moved by all three performers, knocked out by their musicianship, and entertained by the wonderful, often hilarious stories they tell about their songs and careers.  This show promises to be as good as it gets!  All are welcome to join us for an enchanting and entertaining evening at Trinity's Spotlight Concert Series in Berwyn, PA.\n\nThe doors will open at 6:30 PM and the concert will begin at 7 PM.  There is no charge for admission, but a free-will offering of $20 per person is recommended.Trinity Presbyterian Church is located on Berwyn Avenue, 1 block south of Route 30 (Lancaster Pike) in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Parking is free.  The GPS address for the main church parking lot is 51 Waterloo Ave, Berwyn PA, 19312.\n",

The growth of the crossroads community of Sugartown mirrored developments in all of Chester County. Thanks to the enterprising Quakers, Chester County was recognized as the \u201cbreadbasket\u201d of the nation and one of the most agriculturally advanced regions of southeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nAmid the backdrop of the 18th and 19th-century carriages and sleighs on exhibit in Historic Sugartown\u2019s Carriage Museum, regional historian Catherine Quillman will share her research on the vital role of transportation and agriculture on the 19th-century experience here in Chester County. Her illustrated talk will include vintage photographs and will draw connections to the transportation and agricultural collections preserved by Historic Sugartown. The Carriage Museum is a partnership with Chester County Historical Society.\n\nAdmission: $10/ per person, includes wine, cheese and other light refreshments.\n\nThe lecture will take place in Historic Sugartown\u2019s Carriage Museum, located at 273 Boot Road, Malvern PA. Pre-registration is appreciated!\n\n\n\nPurchase tickets below or call 610-640-2667 to register!\n\n\n\nHistoric Sugartown, Inc., a private, nonprofit organization, inspires the community to engage with the past through authentic 19th-century experiences, participate in the village\u2019s present life and protect it for the future. Located in the heart of Willistown Township, Historic Sugartown stewards 9.2 acres of land and nine historic structures, including 4.2 acres of open space under conservation easement with Willistown Conservation Trust. Historic Sugartown\u2019s Carriage Museum interprets Chester County\u2019s rich transportation heritage through a rare collection of historic carriages and sleighs in partnership with Chester County Historical Society. Historic Sugartown offers guided tours of the village on weekends from May through the first weekend in December, as well as workshops in its Book Bindery and other programs throughout the year.  School and group tours are available year-round.  For more information, visit HistoricSugartown.org, or like us on FaceBook.\n\nCatherine Quillman is the author of several books covering regional culture, including 100 Artists of the Brandywine Valley, which showcases painters and sculptors. More recently, Catherine co-authored (with Sarah Wesley) Walking the East End: A Historic African-American Community in West Chester, PA. Catherine spent several years covering the arts and culture scene for the Philadelphia Inquirer, and she is known for advocating for the preservation of historic structures in West Chester. She offers illustrated presentations on everything from \u201cIndian Hannah\u201d and the early Quakers, to the history of the nation\u2019s first turnpike and West Chester\u2019s grandest estate, \u201cGreystone Hall.\u201d\n",

Ms. Zanicchi and The Platters represent the multi-generational kinship that symbolizes the unity of the Italian and American people via the universal language of music.\n\nThe purpose of the tour is threefold. One: To celebrate and thank the American people for liberating Italy from Nazi occupation under reviled Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on April 25, 1945. Two: Raise awareness of Italian arts and culture in honor of the international release of the new, critically acclaimed Italian comedy-drama Briciole Sul Mare. The motion picture is currently under consideration as an official nominee for a prestigious David di Donatello Award. Three: To raise funds for the Italian Red Cross to help the victims of central Italy\u2019s recent earthquakes. \n\nBriciole Sul Mare tells the story of a fisherman living in the south of Italy whose regular fishing trip takes an unexpected turn when he falls asleep. During his slumber, he drifts south to the waters of beautiful, sunny Sicily. There, he meets many new people, including Salvo, a young man who finds himself in a whirlwind of romance, family drama and legal trouble\u2014all which could completely alter his future. The film is full of dramatic and comical waves that rise and fall so unexpectedly that any avid roller coaster rider would be envious. During the tour, Ms. Zanicchi will introduce three of Italy\u2019s rising star vocalists to North America\u2014 Briciole film star and director, Walter Nestola, Paola Gruppuso (from Italy's RAI-TV's The Voice), both of whom are featured on the films official motion picture soundtrack, and Italy's hottest new music sensation, Amato Scarpellino.\n\nVIP Meet &amp; Greet Reception at 6:00 PM\n",

In-depth, we explore adoption, new organizational design, systems thinking &amp; optimization, the role of management, and very concretely how to work together in a Sprint at scale in terms of coordination, architecture, planning, and much more.\n\nPerhaps most importantly and interestingly, this course runs mostly as a series of \"at giant whiteboards\" deep-thinking exercises involving systems modeling in small teams to explore why, so that people can own the ideas by discovering them for themselves, rather than \"renting\" the ideas. A focus on why and owning not renting are important elements of LeSS and how it's learned, and Craig emphasizes this in the course learning experience.\n\nThe course also includes in-depth Q&amp;A clinics with Craig Larman, based on his long experience with LeSS adoptions.\n\nFeedback from previous courses\n\n\u201cIt was inspiring to discuss Large-Scale Scrum with Craig Larman.

        "description": "Get tickets: http://ticketf.ly/2ghAGF5\n\nWXPN 88.5 Welcomes ...\n\nModern English\n\nModern English are an English rock band best remembered for their songs \"I Melt with You,\" \"Hands Across the Sea,\" and \"Ink and Paper\". The group disbanded for a period in 1991, but later recorded in 1995 with some new members. The original members reformed in 2009 and are currently touring with plans for a new release in 2016!\n\nFormed in Colchester, Essex, England, in 1979 by Robbie Grey (vocals), Gary McDowell (guitar, vocals), and Michael Conroy (bass, vocals), Modern English were originally known as The Lepers. The group expanded to \"Modern English\" when Richard Brown (drums) and Stephen Walker (keyboards) were subsequently added to the line-up of the band.\n\nAfter a single on their own 'Limp' label in 1979, the band signed to 4AD the following year, with two further singles released, and a session for John Peel recorded before the band's debut album, Mesh & Lace, in 1981, the band in the early days showing a strong Joy Division influence. A second Peel session was recorded in October 1981. The follow-up, After The Snow (April 1982), was more keyboard-oriented and was compared to Simple Minds and Duran Duran. It was also released in the United States by Sire Records the following year, where it reached number 70 on the Billboard chart, and sold over 500,000 copies. Grey said of the album, \"We used to think 'God, we'll never make a pop record. We're artists!', but things don't always turn out as you planned and when you actually create a pop record, it's so much more of a thrill than anything else\". The second single from the album was also a hit in the US, the jangly \"I Melt With You\" reaching number 78. When he reviewed the album, Johnny Waller of Sounds described the track as \"A dreamy, creamy celebration of love and lust, which deserves to be showcased on as 12\" single all by itself, with no b-side\", while his colleague Tony Mitchell described it as \"susburban amateurism at its most unrewarding\". The band relocated to New York City and worked on a third album, Ricochet Days, which again made the top 100 in the US, after which the band left 4AD and were solely signed to Sire. The single \"Stop Start\" (1986) was the last record Modern English record released by Sire, the band splitting up.\n\nGrey and Conroy along with Modern English worked with This Mortal Coil before re-forming Modern English with Mick Conroy and Aaron Davidson for a new album in 1990, Pillow Lips, now on the American TVT label. The album featured a re-recorded \"I Melt With You\", which was released as a single, and saw the band again in the Billboard top 100. The band split up for a second time in 1991, after contractual problems with TVT, with Grey forming Engine. In 1995, with the legal issues with TVT sorted out, Engine evolved into the next incarnation of Modern English and signed to the Imago label, with Grey and Matthew Shipley (keyboards). This line-up recorded the 1996 album Everything Is Mad.\n\nRobbie Grey toured the US with a new Modern English lineup coast to coast across the US and recorded a new album with Hugh Jones (producer of Melt With You). The songs written with guitarist Steven Walker and other memebers came together on the road and back home in London between tours , after a few years on the shelf this collection of songs was released in May 2010 called \"Soundtrack\", along side the reissued and remastered \"Stop Start\" album also released at the same time. The original members reunited & reformed in 2009 and are currently touring; planning for a new release in 2016!\n\nVenue Information:\nJohnny Brenda's\n1201 N.

        "description": "Borgore w/ 12th Planet and Prince Fox (18+ w/ valid photo I.D.)\n\nSaturday, March 18th, 2017\n\n18+ | Doors: 7:30PM | Show: 8:30PM\n\nTix: http://bit.ly/Tix_Borgore (On-Sale: 12/12 at 12PM!)\n\nElectric Factory\n421 North 7th Street\nPhiladelphia PA 19123\n\n\u25ca Borgore \u25ca\nwww.therealborgore.com\nwww.facebook.com/Borgore\nwww.twitter.com/borgore\nwww.instagram.com/borgore\n\nA dubstep producer and vocalist irreverent enough to pen a tune called \"Act Like a Ho\" (\"but first do the dishes\"), Israeli producer Asaf Borger, aka Borgore, creates a brash, aggressive form of metal-influenced EDM that he refers to as \"gorestep.\" Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Borger played drums in a metal band called Shabira, and began producing tracks and remixes under the Borgore handle toward the end of the 2000s. In 2009, he released two online mixtapes (Goresteps Most Hated and Ice Cream Mixtape) and an EP (Gorestep, Vol. 1), and appeared on the 12\" EP Viridian released by American label Terminal Dusk. His profile was raised by a spate of 2010 releases that were crude both lyrically and sonically. Ice Cream (featuring \"Act Like a Ho\" as a B-side) was issued on Trill Bass and \"Birthday and the Black November\" appeared on Audio Freaks, while Borgore Ruined Dubstep and Borgore Ruined Dubstep, Pt. 2 were the first releases on Borger's Buygore label. A fifth Borgore EP, Delicious, was released the following year, while Buygore remained active with other releases from Tomba, Bare, and Bare Noize.\n\nBorger released Filthiest Hits...So Far on Sumerian Records in 2011, and mixed the first disc of Ministry of Sound's Sound of Dubstep compilation that year. Another mix album, Borgore's Misadventures in Dubstep, followed on Buygore in 2012. Several EPs/singles appeared on the label that year as well, including \"Decisions,\" which featured guest vocalist Miley Cyrus. He continued to churn out releases and remixes during 2013 and 2014, including many singles and EPs for Spinnin' Records and Dim Mak. He collaborated with Waka Flocka Flame on the 2013 single \"Wild Out,\" as his style was increasingly becoming more influenced by trap. Borgore's debut production album, #NEWGOREORDER, appeared on Dim Mak in July 2014. The Buygore Album followed early in 2015, and the year found Borgore collaborating with Addison (\"School Daze\") and G-Eazy (\"Forbes\"), in addition to releasing the Keep It Sexy EP.\n\n\u25ca 12th Planet \u25ca\nwww.facebook.com/12thplanet\nwww.soundcloud.com/12thplanet\nwww.twitter.com/12thplanet\n\n12th Planet is the electronic music pioneer whose off-axis beats and subsonic frequencies orbit on the forefront of global bass culture. Recently named \u201cLos Angeles dubstep god\u201d by Rolling Stone, 12th Planet AKA John Dadzie and his influential label SMOG Records are widely credited for bringing the British movement stateside, and continue to be a crucial force in the evolution of electronic music. 12th Planet's DJ sets now include a myriad of styles that reflect the current, diverse landscape of EDM music and continue to display his role as an essential tastemaker in the dance music world. 12th Planet burst onto the scene in 2006, releasing tracks that helped ignite the North American EDM explosion and collaborating with the likes of Skrillex, Kill The Noise, Datsik and Plastician. In 2012, 12th Planet\u2019s seminal track \u201cReasons\u201d (Doctor P Remix) was named by SPIN Magazine as one of the \u201830 Greatest Dubstep Songs of All Time\u2019 -- after all, \u201cnothing set the tone for domestic bass culture quite like this Planet's orbit,\u201d said SPIN. 12th Planet has gone on to be recognized as \u201cKing of Dubstep\u201d by SPIN and \u201cUS dubstep godfather\u201d by UK\u2019s dance music bible Mixmag after headlining tours across the globe and performing at major festivals including Coachella, Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Music Festival and more. Since 2006, 12th Planet has also led what\u2019s become one of the most thriving underground movements in electronic music, with MTV calling the crew a \u201cpioneering incubator of bass music in America.\"\n\n\u25ca Prince Fox \u25ca\nwww.princefoxmusic.com/#1\nwww.facebook.com/PrinceFoxmusic\nwww.twitter.com/PrinceFoxMusic\n\nPrince Fox wants to give something deeper to the dance floor. So, he approaches making electronic dance music with a classic ear for songwriting, generating his very own \u201cfuture pop\u201d in the process. His last single, \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Love You\u201d ft. Melody Noel, has now accrued over 1.6 million Spotify streams, more than 1.4 million Soundcloud plays, and climbed into the Top 20 on the iTunes Electronic Chart and the Top 30 on the Dance Airplay Chart. Most recently, \u201cFragile\u201d featuring Hailee Steinfeld made its world premiere on Billboard. This epic collaboration teams PRINCE FOX with the Academy Award\u00ae-nominated actress and multiplatinum singer for an emotional future-pop anthem. The New York artist and producer explains, \u201cThe songs are structured in a traditional manner with verses and choruses, but they\u2019re produced with an underground flavor\u2014spanning everything that influences me from deep house, to future bass, to UK garage. What holds it all together is this old school focus on composition. I want to write songs that are more than just builds and drops.\u201d",

Twice ranked amongst the world\u2019s \"10 Best DJ\u2019s\" by DJ Magazine (the bible of the EDM scene), and with over 14 million hits on YouTube and a #8 position on the Billboard charts, the Israel-bred, L.A. based duo Amit \u201cDuvdev\u201d Duvdevani and Erez Eisen have created one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world of dance music. \n\nFollowing the success of Infected\u2019s 2009 album \"The Legend of the Black Shawarma\", Erez and Duvdev delivered their most multi-faceted electronic album to date with \"Army of Mushrooms\" in 2012 on Dim Mak Records. More recently, the duo released \"CVII\", a long-awaited sequel to their critically acclaimed 2003 album \"Converting Vegetarians\". \n\nAdoring fans continue to congregate en masse for Infected Mushroom\u2019s averaged 120 show/year tour. Their jaw-dropping live performances never fail to impress with psychedelic visuals, their trademark enigmatic vocals, hypnotic arrangements, and psy-trippy synthetic rhythms. \n\nInfected Mushroom continues to sell out shows around the globe and all walks of life gather in attendance for the same reason: to experience the world\u2019s greatest Psy-Trance band of the decade.\n\nMore TBA \n____________________________________________\n18+\nDoors @ 8pm\n\nTLA\n334 South St, \nPhiladelphia, PA 19147\n\nwww.SteezPromo.com\nhttp://venue.tlaphilly.com/",

While Boards of Canada's blissful/melancholic IDM is an obvious inspiration, many of Tycho's productions play out like complete electronic dream pop songs in isolation rather than vignettes or extended mood pieces. Tycho debuted in 2002 with The Science of Patterns, a self-released four-track EP. Sunrise Projector, his first album, was released in 2004 on the Gammaphone label. After the album was re-released on Merck in 2006 under the title Past Is Prologue, he settled in with Ghostly International, where he released a trio of singles and EPs (\"The Daydream,\" \"Adrift,\" \"Coastal Brake\") and provided artwork and graphic design under his visual artist moniker, ISO50. As with many Ghostly artists, Tycho's music received much exposure via Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late-night programming block and website, appearing as background and interstitial music during the network's broadcasts and being included on compilations such as 2008's Ghostly Swim. \n\nIn 2010, Hansen established a full-band lineup of Tycho, including guitarist and bassist Zac Brown, drummer Rory O'Connor, and bass guitarist/keyboard player Joe Davancens. The group became an incredibly popular live act, appearing at numerous festivals as well as headlining several sold-out tours. Tycho's long-awaited full-length Dive arrived on Ghostly in 2011, and was well received. While working on material and singles for his next LP, 2013 saw the vinyl reissue of Past Is Prologue on Ghostly. Awake, Tycho's proper follow-up to Dive, was released in early 2014, and was another success, charting at number 23 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart, an unusual feat for an IDM album. Following two more years of constant touring and graphic design work, Tycho released Awake Remixes on Ghostly in early 2016, with a new studio album in the works. Later that year, the singles \"Division\" and \"Epoch\" preceded the full-length Epoch, which was given a surprise release that September. The album was nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards.",

        "description": "\u201cThe power of one person and one instrument \u2013 engaging and exciting in itself. I believe that\u2019s the root of folk music\u201d. \nWith her third album, Apartments For Lovers, Shawna Caspi taps right into those folk roots, stripping away the session musicians and elaborate arrangements of her previous records in favour of a simple, authentic sound \u2013 her solo guitar and voice. The result is a collection of songs that is close-up and honest, showcasing her warm vocals, classically-trained fingerstyle guitar playing, and intimate songwriting in a genuine, powerful way.\n\nOn Apartments For Lovers, Shawna creates delicate, quiet moments that are vulnerable and accessible even when she\u2019s writing about someone else. Her songs are snapshots \u2013 moments that may appear small, but which subtly carry weight and offer greater depth thanks to her well-crafted lyrics.\n\n\u201cSome musicians make songwriting sound less of a craft and more of a life affirming obsession. Caspi\u2019s compositions stand out as beautiful, complex and intricate\u2026\u201d \u2013 NOW Magazine, NXNE preview\n\nFor 15 years, Shawna has been playing the guitar she bought at the Ottawa Folklore Centre, one of Canada\u2019s best loved music stores. This cherished instrument has accompanied her on tour throughout Canada and the United States, where she has played festivals including the Blue Skies Music Festival, the Summerfolk Festival, the Deep Roots Music Festival, and the Ottawa Grassroots Festival. It was also her constant companion as she played on the long haul trains between Montreal and Halifax and between Vancouver and Toronto as part of the VIA Rail On Board Entertainment Program.\n\nWhile she never had one particular musical influence growing up, Shawna found inspiration in a wide variety of independent singer/songwriters as she played and sang her way through the folk music scene. Some of these artists are now her peers, and she has shared the stage with several of her favourites, including Rose Cousins, Jon Brooks, James Keelaghan, Old Man Luedecke, Suzie Vinnick, and Garnet Rogers.\n\n\u201cShawna Caspi has the rare gift of presence that immediately invites audience engagement, from the first strum of her skilled guitar playing to the last exquisite note she sings\u201d. \u2013 Andy Frank, co-founder of Roots Music Canada\n\nFrom cafes, soft-seat theatres, living rooms, festival stages, and yes, even trains, Shawna is making her living singing her stories on tour. She loves the landscapes of her travels and while weaving them into her songs, she has also been portraying them on canvases. Shawna paints one-of-a-kind works of art inspired by the rich scenery she sees and makes them available for sale with her merchandise. Two of those paintings make up the front and back cover artwork for Apartments For Lovers.\n\nShawna\u2019s Canadian folk roots are an intrinsic part of who she is. In fact, Shawna as a solo musician is exactly who she is as a person \u2013 warm, inviting, a storyteller, a traveler, an authentic artist. \u201cAnd at the heart of everything\u201d, she says, \u201cI\u2019m just a really big music fan\u201d.\n",

Women from different ages, social and cultural backgrounds, and professions are all welcome to participate. No previous sewing experience is required. All materials will be provided including: new kitchen cloths, embroidering thread, and embroidering needles. Participants are also welcome to bring their own used or new kitchen cloth, tea towel, or dish towel to embroider. \n\nEmbroidered pieces from this workshop can either be taken home by the participants or donated to Dana's collaborative large-scale textile installation called The Rags Between Us, an exhaustive exploration of rags, kitchen cloths, dishtowels and tea towels donated by family, friends, acquaintances and strangers. The project re-frames and reenacts ordinary cloths into affective materials, actions, and spaces that embody female narratives of alliances and disconnections with cleaning and sustenance. \n\n\n\nDana has hosted and facilitated three embroidering circles where she collaborated with over 100 women to embroider old and new cloths while engaging in a deeply enriching experience, sharing time, labour, and conversations. In each occasion, our old rags and our most dear female relationships and narratives have been our muses of inspiration.\n\nAbout the FacilitatorDana Prieto is an Argentine artist and educator based in Toronto. She completed a BFA in Drawing and Painting at OCAD University.\n\nHer work circles around the mundane through the creation of spaces, images and actions that propose uncanny participatory experiences. Using ordinary materials such as food, litter and kitchen cloths, her projects reflect on both intimate and social-political issues around migration, belonging, gender and power.\n\nShe has participated in several award-winning collaborative projects working within diverse communities in Toronto, Halifax, Buenos Aires, Rawson, Quito and Belize.\n\n\n\nShe is currently coordinating Critical Soup, an interdisciplinary food-art initiative that opens dialogues about the impacts of Canadian extractive companies in Indigenous and Global South territories.\n\nFind out more on her website.\n\nImage: \u00a9 2015 Dana Prieto.\n",

During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album \"Addiction\" in 2014.\n\nThey decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to \"Dubstep\" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album \"Hybrid Distillery\" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director \"Ebola - Delit2fuite\" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.\n\n*Suport*\n\nBoogie T.\n\nMore info TBA\n",

In the words of its maker, Phase IV is \u201ca sort of sci-fi, surrealistic, ecological suspense story\u2026 a confrontation between man and other species \u2013 in this case ants \u2013 over the apportionment and control of the resources of Earth.\u201d\n\nThe screenplay by Mayo Simon (Futureworld) begins when an unknown cosmic event thrusts ants into a rapid evolution, and they develop a true hive mind. A scientific team investigates the strange Stonehenge-like towers and geometrically perfect designs constructed by ants in the deserts of Arizona, as the local human population flees for their lives. Two scientists set up a computerized lab in a sealed dome, and take in a woman fleeing in refuge. As they study the ants, finding ways to communicate with and combat them, they realize that they themselves are the ones under a carefully controlled surveillance.\n\nOstensibly part of the sub-genre of eco-horror films that proliferated in the 1970s, Kingdom of the Spiders (1977), Empire of the Ants (1977), The Swarm (1978), here the approach is arty, cerebral, and continually visually arresting \u2013 an \u201cant art film\u201d. The remarkable close-up ant photography was shot by Ken Middleham, the insect cinematographer of the 1971 pseudo-doc The Hellstrom Chronicle. Phase IV takes that documentary's premise \u2013 that insects will win the battle for global dominance, not mankind \u2013 and dramatizes it in a way that is often disturbingly plausible. Puzzling to an audience that expected more of a Cold War sci-fi scare flick like Them!, and maybe a little less 2001: A Space Odyssey via Cronenberg\u2019s Stereo and Crimes of the Future, Phase IV was destined for cult classic status. Once seen (especially on the big screen!), it will linger, fear and inspire forever.\n\nBreathtaking and chilling \u2013 don\u2019t mess with the ants!\n",

ONE FINAL SHOW ON 35MM!\n\nDoors 7:00 / Film at 8:00 SHARP!\n\nImagine a world where people\u2019s worst impulses and darkest desires are stimulated by a landscape of synth-pop and bright neon lights. Nothing is quite as it seems as you surrender yourself to the dazzling sights and soothing sounds of the Neon Dreams Cinema Club, a monthly film series exclusive to The Royal Cinema bringing you the best in delightfully surreal neo-noir cinema from the 70's, 80's, and beyond.\n\nThe evening will kick off at 7:30 with a mind-blowing 80\u2019s music video pre-show party before starting the feature presentation at 8:00. There will also be prize giveaways and swag, so roll up those blazer sleeves and get there early!\n\n---\n\nRaven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe), along with his gang of merciless biker friends, kidnaps rock singer Ellen Aim (Diane Lane). Ellen's former lover, soldier-for-hire Tom Cody (Michael Par\u00e9), happens to be passing through town on a visit. In an attempt to save his star act, Ellen's manager, Billy Fish (Rick Moranis), hires Tom to rescue Ellen. Billy and Tom, along with former soldier McCoy (Amy Madigan), battle through dangerous cityscapes, determined to get Ellen back.\n\n\u201cStreets Of Fire, is, by design, comic book in orientation, mock-epic in structure, movie-heroic in acting style, operatic in visual style and cowboy-cliche in dialogue. I tried to make what I would have thought was a perfect movie when I was in my teens \u2013 I put in all the things I thought were great then and which I still have great affection for, custom cars, kissing in the rain, neon, trains in the night, high-speed pursuit, rumbles, rock stars, motorcycles, jokes in tough situations, leather jackets and questions of honor.\u201d -Walter Hill, director of Streets Of Fire\n",

The title for the concert is also the sub-title of Rudolf Komorous\u2019 piece Dame\u2019s Rocket (The Rainbow of Forgetting 2). Its combination of evocative beauty and elusive obscurity is very much in keeping with Komorous\u2019 estetiku divnosti, his \u201caesthetic of curious things\u201d / \u201caesthetic of the strange\u201d / \u201caesthetic of the wonderful.\u201d Komorous developed this philosophy with a group of like-minded artists in Prague during the late 1950s. In an interview he explained that \"the group's main philosophy was that things should somehow be driven on the edge\u2014on that edge when you cannot really recognize what's serious, what's not serious; you know, what's true, what's not true; what's sort of from life and what is a sheer imagination. Simply that edge\u2014because we thought that on that edge real things happen.\u201d This concert brings together six extremely different\u2014wonderfully different\u2014pieces of music. Yet all this music, in utterly distinct ways, is driven on the edge, moves along and inhabits that edge, and encourages the listener to join it there.\nPROGRAMME\n\nMartin Arnold: (Damper) Coaster (2000)\n\nLinda Bouchard: Ductwork (1997)\n\nRudolf Komorous: Dame's Rocket (the rainbow of forgetting 2) (1991)\n\nMarjan Mozetich: Time to Leave (1997)\n\nJohn Mark Sherlock: Necklace (1997)\n\nLinda Catlin Smith: Stare at the River (2010)\n",

Author of From Conflict to Creative Collaboration: A User's guide to Dynamic Facilitation, Rosa has been practicing this work since 2000 and leads workshops internationally. \n\nDynamic Facilitation is a \npowerful way to support  groups that are working on challenging issues \nacross highly diverse perspectives. Originally designed by consultant \nJim Rough,  It's a particularly useful way for working across silos and \nwith multi-stakeholder groups -- wherever we want to tap the creative \npotential of differences.\n\t More info on it below. \n\nThis is a rare opportunity to learn this powerful approach, from a gifted practitioner and teacher. \n\nHeart-Centered Listening describes Rosa's continually evolving practice, which \nalso incorporates elements of Focusing &amp; experiential listening, transformative \neducation, action research, Systemic Constellations work, and more.  \n\tYou can learn more about Rosa and her work at www.Diapraxis.com\n\n\nOur hosting team includes:\n\nLeah Boyd is a \nmediator, facilitator, and communications skills trainer.

Here is a \n\t\n\t 5 minute overview video  of a recent Civic Council held in Vorarlberg, Austria in response to the current refugee crisis.\n\nDynamic Facilitation can also be used productively  in a business context.

Miss Major is a veteran of the Stonewall Rebellion and a survivor of Attica State Prison, a former sex worker, an elder, and a community leader and human rights activist. She is simply \u201cMama\u201d to many in her community. Her personal story and activism for transgender civil rights intersects LGBT struggles for justice and equality from the 1960s to today. At the center of her activism is her fierce advocacy for her girls, trans women of color who have survived police brutality and incarceration in men\u2019s jails and prisons. MAJOR! is more than just a biographical documentary: It\u2019s an investigation into critical issues of how the Prison Industrial Complex represents a wide-spread and systematic civil rights violation, as well as a historical portrait of diverse LGBT communities, told with love and humor, and personalized through the lens of a vibrant and charismatic woman. Through first-person narration and innovative visual story telling, MAJOR! seeks to create a living, breathing history of a community's struggle and resilience, as seen and experienced by those who lived it.At the heart of MAJOR! is a social justice framework that puts the subjects at the center of their story. MAJOR! was produced in collaboration with Miss Major, the film\u2019s participants, and a transPOC Community Advisory Board to ensure that these stories, which are so often marginalized, exoticized, or played for tragic drama, retain the agency and humanity of those who tell them.\n\nPlease visit Miss Majors Circle of Care here:\n\nhttp://www.missmajorfilm.com/circle-of-care.html\n\nWe would like to acknowledge and honour that all of the work we do is currently being done on unceded Algonquin Territory that was never given up and never surrendered.\n\nOCTEVAW: http://www.octevaw-cocvff.ca/\n\n Accessibility note:\n\t The Mayfair does have an accessible entrance.

While we recognize that no space is exclusively \u201csafe\u201d for anyone, we must collectively work towards mitigating harms.\n\n Queering613 works towards recognizing dynamics of power and privilege that exist within society and which have historically oppressed our communities. We believe that these same dynamics and tensions exist within our own communities and we are working continuously towards addressing these tensions and creating supportive spaces. People participating in our events and dance parties are asked to be aware of their language and behavior and to think about whether these may be harming others.

In East Berlin, Alex\u2019 mother, a staunch socialist, falls into a coma only to wake up after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Will her weak heart withstand the triumph of capitalism in her beloved country? To save his mother, Alex transforms the family apartment into an island of the past, a kind of socialist museum where his mother is lovingly duped into believing that nothing has changed. What begins as a little white lie gets out of hand as mum wants to watch TV and even leaves her bed one day...\n\nIn a wonderful, touching and comic manner, the multi-award-winning Good Bye Lenin! tells the story of how a loving son tries to move mountains to restore his mother to health - and keep her in the belief that Lenin really did win after all.\n",

When blight strikes her pastoral home, she sets sail  to find Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a powerful, mysterious demigod who may hold key to stopping the encroaching evil.\n\nFive reasons why you should see this film, posted by Alamo founder (and father of twin girls) Tim League:\n\n1) Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson is a great singer and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote the music.  I'd love to see The Rock win an Oscar for his particularly catchy signature song \"You're Welcome;\" he very well may.\n\n2) As good as The Rock's song was, Jemaine Clement's is better. His sassy, bedazzled crab respectfully channels Bowie in my favorite song of the film, \"Shiny.\"\n\n3) Not to get so hyped up on the music, but the soundtrack is fabulous. I made it to Hamilton twice this year, and if you are one of us, you want more, and Moana is just that.... Lin Manuel Miranda is a national treasure.\n\n4) It really just works. No, it's not in my top ten animated films of all time, but it is really, really good: fun, smart, funny, beautiful and loaded with seriously great music. Plus afterward you can spend hours on Wikipedia researching Polynesian mythology with your kids.\n\n5) Moana is a bonafide feminist role model. She's correctly proportioned, and there is not a romantic subplot anywhere in sight. \n\n(Alamo Drafthouse)\n",

As such, it can determine the thermodynamically minimum consumption of hot and cold utilities necessary for the plant, and provide insight into design or retrofit options that may attain these targets. Energy savings ranging from 10 to 30% are typical, even in up-to-date plants that have been subject to conventional energy audit methods, resulting in cost savings, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water savings, and increased production throughput.\n\nINTEGRATION software, an easy-to-use but powerful tool available for free from NRCan, assists in the application of process integration techniques to complex industrial plants with high heat requirements. INTEGRATION also includes modules for quickly evaluating heat recovery opportunities for boilers, refrigeration systems, and compression systems.\n\nDuration: approximately 3.5 hours\n\nParticipants will be given an evaluation version of the INTEGRATION software that they can install on a laptop for use during the course.\n\nFor other free introductory courses, see http://www.rerinfo.ca/RETScreenTraining.html\n",

Our goal is to mix play and programming. Classes are designed using a holistic approach to learning. A typical class begins with an introduction to programming by the class acting out stories they will later program on the computer. Students take turns writing a script using interactive tiles that the rest of the class to acts out. These short stories are then written in Scratch, a programming language developed by MIT on a Raspberry Pi device. Through these projects, girls learn more than computer science, they learn to work through project challenges in a collaborative method and ultimately present their final products to the group.\u00a0",

Together, we will identify our sector\u2019s most pressing challenges and find new and innovative ways to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for Canada\u2019s young people.\n\nABOUT THE 2017 SUMMIT\n\nThe Sandbox Project is proud to partner with the Children and Youth in Challenging Contexts (CYCC) Network for our most interactive event yet. Wisdom2Action (W2A) is an event format designed by the CYCC Network to facilitate cross-sectoral knowledge sharing and connection building across the child and youth serving sector.\n\nThe W2A approach provides a unique opportunity for participants to meet face to face, share practice-based evidence, evidence-based knowledge, and local knowledge and build lasting connections. Part of the day will be devoted to breaking into Open Space \u2013 a small group discussion format. At this time, we\u2019ll be inviting participants to host a conversation on a topic of their choice, or to share their own promising practice, lessons learned, or challenges we can overcome together. No PowerPoints necessary!\n\nWe are happy to be joined once again by Canadian Olympian and Sandbox Project Board Director, Martin Reader, who will serve as our MC for the day.\n\n2017 THEME: FAIRNESS FOR CHILDREN\n\nUNICEF\u2019s latest Report Card, Fairness for Children, found that Canada is one of the most unequal societies for children and youth, ranking 26th of 35 affluent nations. Inequality limits the potential of children broadly \u2013 not only those who fall farthest behind. If we close the inequality gaps between children in the middle and those at the bottom, overall child well-being should improve for all of Canada\u2019s kids. Each of us has experience and insight to share as we work toward closing the inequality gaps \u2013 from the community level through to the federal level.\n\nOur lunchtime discussion will provide a unique opportunity to inform current research on the state of child and youth health and wellbeing in Canada. We will use design thinking techniques to generate ideas and explore trends that will help shape the Canadian Index of Child and Youth Wellbeing led by UNICEF Canada.\n\n\n\nThank you to TELUS, the AstraZeneca Young Health Program, Yellow Pages Canada and the Mental Health Commission of Canada for their generous support of the 2017 Sandbox Summit.\n\n\n\n\n",

Through facilitated discussions and other interactive activities, our aim is to better understand the types of support available from both the public and private sector to make scaling of manufacturers not only possible, but more inclusive.\n\nAs businesses scale-up in cities, UMA recognizes that there is an urgent need to leverage that growth to advance equity. Inclusive manufacturing can take a variety of forms\u2014from examining how maker spaces and academic institutions can work within their local communities to build talent pipelines to accelerator programs that support the growth of minority and women entrepreneurs to creating more connectedness with local job-seekers.  An honest dialogue between businesses, policymakers and practitioners can help pave the way for greater connectivity between makers, manufacturers and the cities of which they are an essential part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft Agenda\n\nWednesday, May 17th - Welcome Reception Hosted by Autodesk Education Experiences at BUILD Space - Boston\n\nTENT: 5:30pm - 8:30pm\n\n\n\nThursday, May 18th - Main Gathering Event - Aeronaut Brewing Company - Somerville\n\n9:00am - Registration Opens\n\n10:00am - Event Begins / Welcome Address\n\n10:15am - Presentation around Making, Scaling &amp; Inclusion\n\n10:45am - Networking Break\n\n11:15am - Somerville Rapid Shares\n\n12:15pm -- Lunch / Networking Break\n\n1:15pm - National Rapid Shares Session\n\n2:15pm - Networking Break\n\n2:45pm - Facilitated Breakout Sessions\n\n4:30pm - Reconvene / Closing Remarks\n\n\n\n5:00pm - Happy Hour at Aeronaut with Maker / Manufacturer Resource Fair\n\n\n\nFriday, May 19th - Manufacturing Tours - Boynton Yards\n\n10:00am - 1:00pm\n\n Locations TBD, but could include Taza Chocolate, FormLabs, Union Square Donuts, Somerville Brewing Company, and more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout UMA Gatherings\n\nUMA Gatherings serve as an opportunity to create a more interconnected urban manufacturing ecosystem: from makers and manufacturers, to those who support their work in municipal government, workforce nonprofits and academic institutions. Further, they provide a needed space to develop new policies and share ideas to support the resurgence of manufacturing in American cities.\n\n\n\nFollowing an \u201cunconference\u201d model, UMA members interact through facilitated discussions, rapid-style presentations and networking opportunities. Gathering attendees develop their own agendas by selecting discussion areas from UMA\u2019s Communities of Practice: workforce development, land use and real estate development, local branding and equity, as well as other relevant areas of interest, such as scaling up and industry-related breakout groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout UMA\n\nUMA is a coalition of 500 members across 145 cities who are sustaining and growing manufacturing in urban centers. Manufacturing matters, and it matters deeply to the health and vitality of cities. A strong urban manufacturing base supports innovation, sustains living-wage jobs that provide a crucial pathway to the middle class, promotes workforce inclusion and increasingly advances environmental sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Somerville\n\nA small, dense city, Somerville has an amazing diversity of makers and manufacturers \u2013 from chocolatiers and foundries, to cideries and machine shops. We will expose attendees to all types of facilities including Artisans Asylum (a community-driven makerspace), Greentown Labs (a prototyping, co-working and shared equipment space for green tech entrepreneurs), Aeronaut Brewing, Union Square Donuts, Taza Chocolate and more. Somerville\u2019s DIY culture and proximity to advanced institutions make it a creative epicenter for the Northeast and our Gathering will feature stories from local service providers, first-hand experiences from manufacturers and a welcome address by current Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation Options\n\nWe are working on a number of hotel block possibilities to get you the best rates possible. We will continue to update this page as options are added.\n\nHoliday Inn - Boston Bunker Hill Area (in Somerville)\n\n\n\tSpecial rate of $289.00 (+tax); call 617-628-1000 to book and use group code \"Urban Manufacturing Alliance for special rate; offer ends 4/17/17. \n\nPorter Square Hotel\n\n\n\tSpecial rate of $229.00 (+tax) for a double twin room; call 617-499-3399 to book and use group code \"SGSU\" for special rate; offer ends 4/17/17.\n\nPhoto Credit: Robert Clark\n",

And who better to learn from than the senior masters of Celtic and Scottish traditional music.  Kelli learned well from these sources and then embraced the exuberant rhythmic fiddle and step dance styles of the French Canadian pioneers.\n\nEvery musical family needs a singer and a songwriter and Kelli\u2019s family was fortunate that she had an amazing ear, a beautifully clear, natural voice, and the desire to use that voice at every opportunity.  Learning the songs she loved from the artists she admired, and giving them wings with her own effortlessly-developing style, soon led to the inevitable writing and performing of her own.\n\nDeveloping her art from these deep and lasting roots, while allowing the influences of contemporary music to help shape her performing and recording career, has earned Kelli a dedicated and growing following and glowing accolades from promoters, organizers and fans.\n\n \u201cI wanted you to know how much we enjoyed your concert tonight. It was a wonderful evening and your natural style with the audience made it extra special.  As we listened to you, many of us had the feeling we were witnessing a great Canadian talent about to skyrocket, and we were there to see the launching!\u201d\n\nNo stranger to the stage, Kelli was featured as the lead female in the Toronto musical production SwingStep.  She is currently touring North America with the very successful Bowfire entourage. Kelli\u2019s soaring vocal pieces are, for many fans, a highlight of the Bowfire productions, often described as \u201cThe finest lineup of fiddle and violin virtuosi ever assembled on one stage.\u201d\n\nKelli has performed for Canadian soldiers in the Middle East and for the Inuit of the Canadian Arctic.  She has brought twenty thousand NHL Ottawa Senators Fans to their feet many times as the featured mid-game entertainer.\n\nIn addition to her extensive performing experience, Kelli continues to be a highly sought-after instructor and judge of fiddle and stepdance events across Canada and parts of the U.S.  She has been nominated three times for Fiddle Player of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association and is featured instrumentally and vocally on many studio recordings for other artists.\n\nAll of this experience is focused on Kelli\u2019s true passion:  performing and touring her music with her band.  Time and again these performances earn glowing reviews, requests to return and always more fans!\n\n\u201cYour show was fantastic, I was thoroughly impressed, the band was unbelievably tight.\u201d\n\n \u201cIn reviewing the DVD of your concert, I hope you notice the audience\u2019s overall response to your show!  You and the Mushy Peas put on a fabulous performance and the club wants you to know how much they appreciated the stage presence and talents you displayed that evening. Your professionalism made the show so well received and successful\u201d\n\nPromoting her six independent recordings; singing, dancing and playing her way to the top of her musical genre, Kelli Trottier is an unforgettable and enchanting artist, consistently delivering performances that raise her stature in the hearts and memories of audiences everywhere.\n",

Register to attend at www.universe.com/monotype\n\nMonotype printing is a painterly and direct process of applying ink or \npaint to a plate (in this case plexi glass) and transferring that image \nto paper using an etching press or pin press - creating one of a kind \nprints.\n\t\n\nIn this workshop artist Gabriel Deerman will introduce you to monotype printing with watercolour and acrylic paints. Each participant will have time to produce and print two plates, resulting in finished original works on paper. The simplicity of the process, forgiving nature of the materials and immediate results make this technique very popular among painters and those who find printmaking to be too process intensive and finicky. While monotype is simple and direct the visual look of the prints and broad possibilities for experimental applications are limitless.Provided materials: Paper, acrylic printing ink, watercolour paint, gum arabic, use of 8\"x10\" plexiglass plates and etching press.High quality Arches printmaking paper will be available for a small fee of $2 per 9\"x11\" sheet (store cost). Each participant will have time to print at least 2 plates. Participants are encouraged to bring watercolour paints and brushes, as well as printed/drawn images (8\"x10\") to use as source material (for tracing) if they wish.About the Instructor: Gabriel Deerman (1979, Bolinas, California, USA) has a practice that is largely grounded in painting, drawing and printmaking but recent forays into sculpture, kinetic devices and installation are leading steadily away from disciplinary categorization. Deerman completed an MFA at Transart Institute (New York / Berlin), a BFA from the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, British Columbia, is a practicing and certified art instructor and has exhibited internationally. Gabriel was the owner/director of independent arts venues in Vancouver and Montreal and is co-founder of Salmon River Studios\u2014 an educational art studio, artist residency and cultural events space located on his farm in Tamworth, Ontario. www.gabrieldeerman.com\n\n\n",

To help with that, we\u2019re carrying over the season ticket price from last year. That\u2019s six home games in the Ohio Building at the Ohio Expo Center for only $70. That\u2019s stability we can all get behind!\n\nWe hope to see you track-side in 2017!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll 2017 games will be held at the Ohio Expo Center, in the Ohio Building. Your season pass can be picked up at the season opener on March 18, 2017, at the Will Call table. \n",

Students take turns writing a script using interactive tiles that the rest of the class to acts out. These short stories are then written in Scratch, a programming language developed by MIT on a Raspberry Pi device. Through these projects, girls learn more than computer science, they learn to work through project challenges in a collaborative method and ultimately present their final products to the group.\u00a0",

Storytellers at the \u201cTall Tales &amp; Silver Linings\u201d themed event include Ashlan Gorse Cousteau (E! Entertainment), Danni Washington (\u201cAfter Earth\u201d), Eric Balfour (\u201cHaven\u201d), youth activist Erin Schrode, Graham Hamilton (\u201cCode Black\u201d), comedian Jake Johanssen, author Jillian Lauren, environmental activists Jordan Howard and Lindsay Dahl, Shiva Rose (\u201cReturn to Babylon\u201d), Steve Connell (\u201cWe Are the Lions\u201d), and designer/entrepreneur Steve Glenn, with surprise guests expected.\n\nVoices 4 Oceans will take place at the beautiful Moss Theater on March 23rd. In addition to the live program, there will be a reception with an open bar, light appetizers and a silent auction. VIP guests will enjoy assigned seating and an exclusive backstage meet-and-greet with our storytellers.\n\nAll proceeds will support the 5 Gyres mission to end the global health crisis of plastic pollution, because:\n\n300 million tons of new plastic is produced in the United States each year and less than 10 percent of plastic is recovered for recycling.\n\t\n\n5.25 trillion particles weighing in at 270,000 tons of \u201cplastic smog\u201d pollute our oceans worldwide\u2014and a full 80% of that marine plastic pollution comes from land.\n\t\n\nMore than 600 species are endangered or killed by marine plastic pollution.\n\t\n\nPlastic wreaks havoc on a marine ecosystem dependent on phytoplankton, which produce 70% of the earth\u2019s oxygen and sequester 40% of its carbon.\n\t\n\nA tiny piece of plastic can be one million times more toxic than the water around it.\n\t\n\nFish are eating these microplastics\u2014and we\u2019re eating the fish.\n\n        We've been fighting plastic ocean pollution since 2009, when 5 Gyres began a series of scientific firsts by researching plastic in all five subtropical gyres, as well as the Great Lakes and Antarctica. In 2014, the organization convened eight scientists around the world to publish the first Global Estimate of Marine Plastic Pollution. Our paper on plastic microbead pollution in the Great Lakes inspired a two-year collaborative campaign that culminated in a federal ban, which President Obama signed into law in 2015. This year, we're taking on polystyrene, while continuing to inspire activism through our art, education, science and adventure programs.\n\nThank you to our sponsors Aquarium of the Pacific, Ben Harper, Brett Stanley, Bodhi Surf School, Brie English, Bureo Skateboards, Costa, Gold Frame Media, Hardwood Music Company,  Hilary Beane Designer Jewelry, Indigenous, Jack Johnson, Jeux de Vagues, Joan Hall, Josie Maran Cosmetics, Karl Strauss Brewing Company, Klean Kanteen, Kris Goto , Life Without Plastic, Manduka, Mark Cunningham, Nordic Naturals, Okiino, Omnibus Delecto, Outerknown, Reed's, Robert Lee, and The Refill Shoppe.\n",

This is the first time the band will have played publicly with an orchestra since shows for their unreleased work Odin\u2019s Raven Magic in 2002-3. \n\nCo-curated by Icelandic composer Dan\u00edel Bjarnason and LA Phil Conductor Laureate Esa-Pekka Salonen, the Icelandic band will perform three nights at Walt Disney Concert Hall, playing career-spanning sets including fan-favorites (with orchestral accompaniment) and - \u201cif things go to plan\u201d - new, unreleased music (without orchestra).\n\nEach Sigur R\u00f3s performance (April 13, 14, 15) will be prefaced by a different symphonic and choral program. On April 13 festival co-curator Salonen will lead the LA Phil in the world premier of a new violin concerto from Dan\u00edel Bjarnason, performed by Pekka Kuusisto.  Bjarnarson first worked with Sigur R\u00f3s when he conducted the session on the band\u2019s song \u201c\u00c1ra B\u00e1tur\u201d London\u2019s Abbey Road for the Me\u00f0 su\u00f0 \u00ed eyrum\u2026 album in 2008.\n\nThe April 13, 14, 15 programs will also include new work from long-term Sigur R\u00f3s collaborator and Amiina member Maria Huld Markan Sigf\u00fasd\u00f3ttir, as well as pieces from Anna \u00deorvaldsd\u00f3ttir and J\u00f3n Leifs. In addition, the orchestra will also present the U.S. premieres of Haukur T\u00f3masson\u2019s piano concerto, with Icelandic soloist Vikingur \u00d3lafsson, and Hlynur A\u00f0ils Vilmarsson\u2019s BD. (see full schedule below)\n\nThe Reykjav\u00edk Festival is designed as an exploration of the eclectic Icelandic music scene, highlighting the creativity thriving in Reykjav\u00edk and covering a wide spectrum of music, from chamber, choral and symphonic to pop music.",

Will people in Des Moines laugh at that joke? Can it stand alone in middle America?

Your audience actually lives between LA and New York and prepping material that travels should be your goal.\n\nIn this class we will be writing new jokes, refine old ones, helping classmates with material and working on delivery. We will also be getting used to a cold stage and audience and learn how to work it to our advantage while not panicking. But most importantly we will work on tapping into saying it your way, saying it differently and being entertaining.\n\n- Shawn Gnandt\n\nPrerequisites: Intro to Stand Up or commensurate experience, with approval\n\nNEXT SESSION:\n\nStand Up 2: Punchlines &amp; Paychecks\n\nMondays 7-10pm | starting March 13th\n\n6 Weeks + Class Show | Cost: $300\n\n3/13, 3/20, 3/27, 4/3,( 4/10 off), 4/17, 4/24\n",

There is one song per year for the fifty years since 1965. Musically the sound ranges as widely and adventurously as possible, within the context of lyrics-driven music.\n\nIn concert the music will be played and sung by seven performers in a stage set featuring fifty years of artifacts both musical (vintage computers, reel-to-reel tape decks, newly invented instruments), and decorative (tiki bar, shag carpet, vintage magazines for the perusal of idle musicians). The seven performers each play seven instruments, traditional (cello, charango, clavichord) or invented in the last 50 years (Slinky guitar, Swarmatron, synthesizer).\n\nEach performance will be a separate program, so that the whole album will be performed over two nights: \n\nNight One: Songs 1-25\nNight Two: Songs 26-50",

Our 70+ events a year in 30+ markets has helped discover some of today's most sought after record producers. This year we intend to take steps to do the same for the up and coming songwriters on 4.16.2017 in LA with the iStandard 'iWrite' Songwriter Experience. With the shift in the music industry leaning towards shopping full songs and tracks with hooks, the songwriter is now (more then ever) an extremely valuable asset to producers when pitching records for major label and flim/tv placements. With 'iWrite' we are basically using the same format as we do with the iStandard Producer Showcase. Each writer will showcase 3 (60 second) song or tracks w/ hook snippets and will be verbally judged on 5 Core criteria (Originality, Quality, Marketability, Melody/Structure and Overall Potential) by grammy winning songwriters, music execs, publishers and various industry tastemakers. The winning songwriter with the highest score overall will win a prize package consisting of a Grammy winning producer studio session, Record label &amp; Publishing entity listening sessions &amp; meetings, Video consultations, interviews and much more.\n\nJudges Include\n\n\n\tBrandon Kitchen (Director of A&amp;R for Disney + Grammy Winning Songwriter)\n\tAshley Calhoun (Creative Director at Pulse Recording)\n\tKrunkadelic (Grammy Nominated and Platinum Producer for Nelly Furtado, Sean Paul, Jamie Foxx)\n\nThe Event Is Powered by ASCAP\n\nSubmit to the iStandard 'iWrite' Songwriter Showcase here at http://istandardproducers.com/showcase_submit\n",

He will bring his \u2018Electronica\u2019 World Tour to North America, marking Jarre\u2019s first-ever proper North American trek.  Expect Jarre to bring his critically-acclaimed live show--which blazed across the European continent last year, to high-acclaim--to many hallmark venues including Microsoft Theater on May 27th. \n\nFamed for staggering visuals and the use of cutting-edge digital technology, which has been seen by millions of people around the world, Jarre\u2019s new live show promises yet again to be a truly immersive musical journey. He\u2019ll showcase brand new music from his two-part LP ELECTRONICA and most recent release OXYGENE 3, alongside classic material from milestone albums such as Oxygene and Equinoxe.\n\nWith his renowned city-scale concerts, Jean-Michel Jarre has set Guinness World records across the globe, including: His memorable one-off city-scale concert in Houston in 1986 for NASA\u2019s 25th Anniversary and in a moving commemoration of the Challenger Mission to which over 1.3 million people gathered to share this groundbreaking show at the foot of Houston\u2019s skyline; an audience of 2.5 million in front of La D\u00e9fense skyline, Paris; and going on to break his very own record in Moscow, when he played to over 3.5 million people for the city\u2019s 850th anniversary.\n\nIn late 2016, Jarre unveiled digitally via Sony Music International the final chapter of his OXYGENE trilogy with OXYGENE 3. The album will now be available in physical format in the U.S. as of March 24 in advance of his \u2018Electronica\u2019 World Tour.  40 years on from the release of his groundbreaking first OXYGENE album and 20 years on from its sequel--JARRE completed the trilogy with seven new original compositions, titled OXYGENE parts 14-20, to cap off a trailblazing four decades in music.  \u201cOxyg\u00e8ne 3 has its place within electronic music\u2019s history,\u201d shared Consequence of Sound while Observer called it \u201csuperlative.\u201d Billboard adds, \u201c\u2026If you're looking for something to get you through the working hours or moments of reflection, put this beast on from beginning to end and watch the productivity and creativity explode.\u201d",

        "description": "The Broad is pleased to present the West Coast premiere of Tyler Hubby\u2019s documentary film, Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present. The film examines the pioneering life and work of artist, musician, and educator, Tony Conrad, and this special iteration of The Un-Private Collection series highlights both his extraordinary career and his influence on the work of Broad collection artists including Mike Kelley, Robert Longo, and Tony Oursler. Since the early 1960s, Conrad's vast, inter-disciplinary repertoire has created and influenced major film and compositional movements. He performed in and recorded the soundtrack to Jack Smith\u2019s legendary film Flaming Creatures; he defied conventions of cinema with The Flicker, an experimental structuralist film composed of a precise pattern of alternating black and white frames; he developed and practiced Just Intonation and Minimalism with Karlheinz Stockhausen and La Monte Young; and he was instrumental in the formation of The Velvet Underground. \n\nA post-screening conversation with Tyler Hubby and Tony Oursler will be moderated by Henry Rollins. Iconic artist and musician, Kim Gordon, who has collaborated with Tony Conrad, will perform to close out the night. Works by Tony Oursler in the Broad collection are currently on view in the collection installation, Creature, through March 19.\n\nBring your ticket for this program to The Broad and skip the line for general admission entry without advance reservation between March 14 - 19.",

        "description": "WonderCon was started in 1987 in Oakland, California, as \u201cThe Wonderful World of Comics Convention.\u201d The show was the brainchild of Bay Area comics retailer John Barrett, who called on a number of friends and associates to help realize his vision, including Bob Borden, Bryan Uhlenbrock, Rory Root, and Mike Friedrich. With the third year, \u201cWonderCon\u201d became the official name of the convention. The original show included all the classic comics convention features: an Exhibit Hall with dealers selling old and new comics and other items, programming, anime screenings, and games. In 2001, after the 15th event, then co-owners Mike Friedrich and Joe Field (another prominent Bay Area comic retailer) decided they could no longer devote the time needed to maintain the quality of the show they helped create. They contacted Comic-Con International in hopes that the organization could fold WonderCon into the Comic-Con family of conventions.\n\nCali Collectibles is not affiliated in any way with WonderCon.\nWe are independently owned and operated.",

It\u2019s there from the outset: the beefed-up beats of Certainty reveal an expanded sonic firmament, one in which bright synth hooks and insistent choruses circle around each other over chord sequences that strike just the right balance between nice and queasy. Shock-haired singer James says, \u201cIf there\u2019s a sense of scale, it was really just a result of implementing a load of things that we didn\u2019t know about the first time around.\u201d Referring back to Sun Structures, a record that was recorded in his house in his native Kettering, James explains, \u201cWe didn\u2019t even have a subwoofer to listen back to things that we did on Sun Structures, so there was nothing below 50Hz on Sun Structures. We didn\u2019t even know those frequencies were there!\u201d Co-founding member and bassist Thomas Warmsley describes a record in which \u201cwe discovered a lot as we went along, and the excitement at having done so radiates outwards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a point perhaps most emphatically born out by Mystery Of Pop and Roman God-Like Man. Both songs make light work of reminding you where Temples have come from and how far they\u2019ve travelled. On the former, Sam Toms\u2019 brittle, piledriving rhythm clears the path for a breathless baroque pop reverie where synth and mellotron interweave to beguiling effect. \u201cI just started with one idea. I wanted something that sounded like it was on the edge of being too fast and like you couldn\u2019t keep up with it,\u201d explains James. Similarly, Roman God-Like Man, in all its pulsating neurotic grandeur, spidered out from a single thought: \u201cIt\u2019s about the pernicious effect of narcissism,\u201d explains its creator Thomas, \u201cBut written from the perspective of someone who works in a world where that\u2019s sort of encouraged.\u201d\n\nHaving produced the first album themselves, Temples saw no reason to enlist outside help for their second album. \u201cIf you\u2019re an artist who doesn\u2019t necessarily know what they\u2019re looking for, I can see that having a producer might be necessary, but that isn\u2019t us.\u201d In fact, ideas for the record were forming and being performed by the last summer. One case in point was the song which inspired the record\u2019s name. Far more immediate that you would ever expect from a song with such an odd time signature, Oh My Saviour was written in Japan, where Temples enjoy an enormous following \u2013 to be specific at the foot of Mount Fuji, near the site of the eponymous rock festival where they played. \u201cThat\u2019s when the album began in earnest for me,\u201d says James. \u201cWe\u2019d pretty much discharged our touring obligations and subconsciously, it was like I was allowing myself to write again, because I knew I could go home and quickly get to work on it. So, actually, that song came remarkably quickly, and it cleared the path for the rest of the record.\u201d\n\nThe confidence boost of getting such a key song in the bag filtered out not only to James and Thomas, but to rhythm guitar and keyboard player Adam Smith, who opened his songwriting account with the infernally catchy In My Pocket. \u201cThat was another one that appeared at the tail end of the last tour,\u201d recalls James, \u201cIt was a song without a chorus and we put it through the Temples filter, which pretty much every song has to go through. One thing I love about our band is that you can\u2019t always tell who wrote what, and that\u2019s what a band should be, I think. It\u2019s a lot easier to make stuff by yourself, what\u2019s easiest isn\u2019t always best. It can be a bit nerve-racking bringing your music to the band, but it also helps you to raise your game.\u201d\n\nIf, as James contends, the process of making Volcano amounted to \u201chard work, with the inevitable moments of self-doubt\u201d, the measure of its success is that you can\u2019t hear the struggle or see the joins. Take, for example, the undulating lysergic dream-pop of Thomas\u2019s Strange Or Forgotten \u2013 \u201ca song about questioning your identity, in a world where everyone is trying to stand out in some way\u201d \u2013 or the sun-dazed oscillations of Open Air which come hitched, incongruously, to a beat one might more readily expect to hear on an old Motown record. In fact, wherever you drop the needle, the melodies seem to come effortlessly \u2013 suggesting at times that Temples have located a bounty of low-hanging melodic fruit that has somehow eluded everyone else. Presented with a song like (I Want To Be Your) Mirror, other bands might have sliced it up for use in three or four separate songs, but Temples seem to know where to go when it\u2019s time to restock. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can be too high-minded about it really,\u201d says James. \u201cWe write songs, but what\u2019s a song without a melody? It\u2019s music, and it might be brilliant music, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a song. And we\u2019re in the business of writing the very best songs we can.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s confident approach to writing new material must in part be a result of the critical acclaim Sun Structures received (\u201cTremendous\u201d \u2013 NME; \u201c60s experimentation smashing stunningly into the present day\u201d Clash). Following on from the enthusiastic reviews, word of mouth continued to spread in the period following the release, songs such as Keep In The Dark, Shelter Song and Mesmerise have dispersed into the collective consciousness. Record shop proprietors soon discovered that if you had it playing, you\u2019d always be sure to sell a few copies. Among the more vocal converts were Johnny Marr and Noel Gallagher, but they were by no means alone.\n\nIndeed, by the end of 2014, Sun Structures had charted in eighteen countries and become the year\u2019s biggest-selling vinyl album in independent British record shops, with early pressings of Shelter Song changing hands on Discogs for up to \u00a3150. Less than a month after Sun Structures landed, the group played to a packed Shepherds Bush Empire. Downstairs, young fans who either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care about the archival inspirations for Temples\u2019 febrile pop spell jettisoned their inhibitions and turned the entire area into a touchy-feely mosh-pit. On the balcony, older fans gazed at the scene below them, somewhat taken aback by the realisation that, in the right hands, psychedelic pop can still say something to you about your life, or even better, allow you to take leave from it for a little while.\n\nOne thing you do notice, however, this time around is that it\u2019s harder to spot the influences. Mystical language has been supplanted by something a more direct. They\u2019ve been broken down and blended together \u2013 fossilised into a single source of creative fuel, so that what you can hear this time around, sounds like nothing so much as Temples. This is the sound of a band squaring up to their potential. It\u2019s hard to make it seem this easy. But don\u2019t be fooled. If it really was that easy, everyone would be at it.\n\n\nNight Beats\n\nDanny Lee Blackwell \u2013 guitar / vocals\nJakob Bowden \u2014 bass\nJames Traeger \u2014 drums\n\nNight Beats play pure psychedelic R&B music that spikes the punch and drowns your third eye in sonic waves of colour. Theirs is a bastard blues, contorted and distorted into new shapes for 21st century wastoids \u2014 once tasted never forgotten. This is music to melt your sorry little minds.\n\nMake no mistake: their new album Who Sold My Generation sounds like it has been created against a backdrop of burning Stars and Stripes flags and with the whiff of napalm hanging in the air \u2014 an alternative universe where \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019 is the national anthem and Charlie Manson is still on the loose. Acid-test heaviness is Night Beats\u2019 currency, but this is no out-right nostalgia trip either. Instead of Nixon and Vietnam, Night Beats have their own epoch of God and guns and bombs and drones to rail against\u2026or flee from. Besides, bad vibrations, blues jams and id-shattering explorations are timeless pursuits \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t today\u2019s young generation be allowed to take a ride down the slippery spiral that sits within the centre of each of us?\n\nDeap Vally\n\nDeap Vally landed in \u20182013\u2019 with their rock debut \u2018Sistrionix\u2019. The LA duo bombed down the Transatlantic speedway, lighting psych-blues fires throughout the US and Europe. Lindsey Troy\u2019s whiskey-soaked vocals and killer guitar riffs were chaotic, but found a degree of order in the heat of Julie Edwards\u2019 drumming. After several loops around the world, they returned from their travels and decided it was time for a gear shift. The change was inspired by the pair\u2019s need to create their vision on their own terms, without label input. Lindsey and Julie needed to be able to operate in a way that didn\u2019t suck the living joy out of their creations, otherwise that blues synergy of rock\u2019n\u2019roll (forged between them at a knitting club in Echo Park some five years ago) would simply not be able to reach its pinnacle.\n\nSo the two-piece took a risk, parted ways with their label (amicably so), and wielded the time they needed to reassess matters by themselves, even doing short stints as touring bass players: Lindsey in White Lung and Julie in JJUUJJUU. \u201cWe were given this gift of time to make the record,\u201d explains Julie, optimistically. \u201cWe kept writing, recording, exploring all these flavours. It was a real luxury.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a luxury many bands don\u2019t get, and it\u2019s strengthened their identity, which has now become an \u201cism\u201d: specifically \u2018Femejism\u2019. That\u2019s the name of the second record. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever wanna do what people expect of us, we always want to do the opposite of that,\u201d says Lindsey, ever the rebel. \u201cLike after a break-up when you cut your hair, dye it, and just explore being free on so many levels.\u201d Julie intercepts, \u201cBut, y\u2019know, within the confines of guitar and drums.\u201d Their new labels \u2013 Cooking Vinyl and Nevado Records \u2013 have put their faith in the ladies\u2019 vision entirely.\n\n\u2018Femejism\u2019 has been two years in the making. \u201cThis is what we wanted: total freedom,\u201d says Julie. The pair explored new territory at recording studios in Downtown LA and the San Fernando Valley. They had a third character in the mix, too, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, who lent key production skills to the pair\u2019s own chemistry. \u201cHe\u2019s pushed our songwriting a lot,\u201d says Lindsey. The pair also explored new territory at recording studios in Downtown LA and the San Fernando Valley, this time honing their producing skills too. The track \u2018Julian\u2019, for instance, was produced entirely by them. Both ladies insist that theirs is a love/hate relationship they\u2019re incapable of explaining. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery that neither of us understand,\u201d says Julie, the yogic yin to Lindsey\u2019s dramatic yang. \u201cWe\u2019re giving ourselves to an alchemy we don\u2019t control but it creates art. It\u2019s raw, hot and loud, you know?\u201d\n\nThe duo always keep their cards close to their chests when it comes to offering explanations. \u201cWhat do you think it means?\u2019\u201d defers Julie on the subject of titles, lyrics, etc. Although they take what they do seriously, Deap Vally try not to take themselves too seriously. There\u2019s a sense of humour that catches you off guard. The only thing they do offer is that true crime and historical characters have inspired some songs. Maybe the self-produced \u2018Julian\u2019 or \u2018Little Baby Beauty Queen\u2019, but who knows? They both kick like a mule regardless.\n\n\u201cI always want there to be some philosophical endgame,\u201d adds Julie. \u201cThey\u2019re personal songs and they\u2019re universal. Nothing\u2019s too mired in emotion.\u201d Lindsey agrees. \u201cWe wanna give people music they deserve.\u201d Take \u2018Teenage Queen\u2019, which comes over like an Alex Turner anthem. //I\u2019m gonna live forever, Snapchat, sex and cigarettes, life is but a dream for a teenage queen// hollers Lindsey. It\u2019s a feverish poke at societal ills, without getting too preachy. In \u2018Critic\u2019 there\u2019s a stripped-back grunge vibe as Lindsey drawls //everyone is a fucking critic, a fucking cynic// in a way that\u2019s so blas\u00e9 as to be positively liberating. The song is sonically the \u201cbiggest departure\u201d for them.\n\n\u201cIt was hard sitting on this record for so long, not knowing what was gonna happen,\u201d says Lindsey. But that waiting made the pair even more ambitious. Julie went ahead and had a baby. \u201cThe baby came out, then we found the perfect partners. It was like it had to happen that way,\u201d Julie muses. Lindsey adds, brazenly, \u201cNow that we have a home I just wanna put out a tonne of records.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Sistrionix\u2019 was a document of the early years of Deap Vally\u201d, Julie concludes. \u201c\u2019Femejism\u2019 is a document of the metaphorical desert we\u2019ve been crossing between towns.\u201d Make sure you bring a bottle of Jack for the ride. You might need it to take the edge off.\n\nFroth\n\nFormed in 2013 in Los Angeles, Froth first garnered attention with their debut LP, \u201cPatterns.\u201d Originally intended as a small-run cassette release, the album quickly became an underground sensation in the Southern California music scene, catapulting the band to local fame and prompting a vinyl re-release in 2014.\n\n2015 saw the release of the band\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cBleak.\u201d A more dynamic, adventurous effort, the record matches lush shoegaze soundscapes with driving krautrock beats. Froth toured extensively across the U.S. and Europe in support of the album, opening for acts such as The Drums, Tamaryn, Pond and Craft Spells.\n\nAfter signing with Wichita Records in 2016, Froth is set to share their third album, \u201cOutside (briefly),\u201d on 2/10/2017. This time around, the band has dialed back the noise, revealing delicately beautiful melodies, intricately arranged instrumentals and some of their most experimental songwriting to date.\n\nJJUUJJUU\n\nJJUUJJUU is an astral union, an arcane ritual, and above all, a conversation.\nHarnessing an unspoken energy, the duo have exponentially blossomed from a sonic experiment to a forceful, telepathic dialogue of distinct-but-aligned vibrations. Releasing this dynamic on an expanding spiral of planned and impromptu live shows in the American southwest, the magnetism of the duo only continues to grow, along with its devoted, traveling coterie of entranced acolytes",

        "description": "TICKETS ON SALE: DECEMBER 6TH @ NOON PST!\nwww.desertheartsfestival.com\n\n21+ \n\nHello Desert Hearts Family!\n\nWow it's good to be back! I think we can all agree that 2016 was one of the craziest years ever, but it's during this adversity that our Love Movement really shines brightest. The world needs love more than anything else right now and it's been our intention since day one to create as much love and positive energy as possible. We hope you'll join us once again at Los Coyotes Indian Reservation, CA on March 31st - April 3rd for our finest Desert Hearts Festival yet. We've been charging up and we're ready to blow your minds.\n\nThere's a reason the mantra of our movement is \"House, Techno, & Love... We Are All Desert Hearts.\" Every single person who attends Desert Hearts is part of our family. A collective consciousness that we tap into together to create the ultimate vibe. Whether you're contributing a theme camp, workshop, your art, or even just a smile, the more you put in the more you get out. When we all go into Desert Hearts with the exact same intention of creating the most amount of love and positive energy possible, we're able to create a tangible vibe that sets the groundwork for the entire weekend. Vibe is king at Desert Hearts, so bring your A-Game, because we\u2019re all bringing ours.\n\nHouse, Techno, & Love\u2026 We Are All Desert Hearts. \u2665\n\nLove Always,\n\nYour Desert Hearts Crew\n\n~ \u2665 Admission \u2665 ~\n\nGates open for General Admission, Friday at 10am. Thursday early arrival passes allow admission Thursday at Noon. Music starts at Noon on Friday and bumps nonstop until Monday at 4pm. Tickets include entrance, camping, and access to all open kitchens, theme camps, & art installations. \n\nFor fastest entry, please print and bring your ticket that will be emailed to you upon purchase. If you can't find the email please check your spam or promotions folder. \n\n* In order to encourage carpooling, an Environmental Impact Fee of $20 will be charged per vehicle. This is intended to greatly help us reduce the amount of traffic entering and exiting the festival grounds. *\n\n\n\n\u2665 Tickets \u2665\n\nGeneral Admission - $200 \nEarly Entry - $60 (Need to also buy a General Admission ticket)\nCar Camping Pass - $80\nRV Camping Pass - $165\n\n\n\u2665 Car Camping, RV Passes, & Early Entry Passes \u2665\n\nIf you are planning to camp in the campgrounds with your vehicle, you will need a Car Camping Pass. If you are arriving in a RV or bus, you will need a RV pass or else you will not be allowed entry. If you don't need to camp directly next to your car, there is a huge parking lot about a 2-5 minute walk to the campgrounds where you'll be able to park and leave your car. It is literally the shortest festival walk you'll ever do so don't even trip when Car Camping Passes sell out.\n\nEarly Entry Passes allow entrance to the festival grounds on Thursday before music starts on Friday. If you would like to enter on Thursday you will still need a regular general admission pass as well.\n\n*Note: All cars & RVs will have to pay the standard $20 Environmental Impact Fee upon arrival, even if you bought a Car or RV Camping Pass. \n\n\n~ \u2665 About Desert Hearts \u2665 ~\n\nOver the past 4 years, the Desert Hearts Family has found itself at the center of a dusty movement, fostering intimate experiences of sonic joy and unbounded love across the globe. Part boutique festival, part record label, and part globetrotting party brigade, this ragtag crew of dreamers has emerged as a vibe-focused force radiating a conscious ethos of House, Techno and Love. \n\nIn November 2012, Desert Hearts began as a 200-person renegade gathering deep in the Mojave Desert, dreamt up by the DH\u2019s founding quintet of Mikey Lion, Lee Reynolds, Porkchop, Marbs, & Kristoff McKay. The intrepid crew barely survived a set of extreme weather conditions and unfortunate circumstances, but that first party sparked a fire. \n\nIn just a few short years what began as a nomadic gathering of friends, has evolved into the darling of the West Coast house and techno scene. Though each edition of the festival may sell out, the DH Crew made the decision to keep the events intimate, ensuring that the love, radical self-expression and positive energy of that first adventure remains at its beating heart. It\u2019s what has attracted world-class bookings like Tiefschwarz, DJ Harvey, Monkey Safari, Rodriguez Jr., DJ T, Claude VonStroke, Marc Houle, Olivier Giacomotto, Mark Henning, M.A.N.D.Y, and many more.\n\n2014 saw the launch of Desert Hearts Records, a totally-free record label embodying the musical sensibility of the movement, while providing a platform to foster established and emerging talent from around the world. Entirely curated by Mikey Lion with Marbs handling the artwork for the label, past releases have included Andreas Henneberg, Latmun, The Glitz, jozif, T\u00c5CHES, Dance Spirit, Fritz Carlton, Kevin Anderson, RYBO, and of course records from the core Desert Hearts Crew.\n\nThe beating heart of Desert Hearts is its founding fathers. A suitably colorful cast of characters, who fell into each other's lives skating and surfing around the beaches of San Diego. Led by top hat sporting label boss Mikey Lion, the core crew is rounded out by ex-pro BMX legend turned DJ, Lee Reynolds, the artistic backbone of the crew, Marbs, Mikey\u2019s younger brother & absolute madman, Porkchop, and renegade visionary Kristoff McKay.\n\nIf the Desert Hearts festival is the epicenter of this movement and the record label its voice, then the roaming City Hearts party series has become the legs that carry this evangelistic cause around the country. A roaming urban distillation of the festival, City Hearts has been sprinkling a little bit of California magic dust across the country and beyond, winning hearts and minds and selling out shows in Los Angeles, New York, Tulum, Mexico City, Miami, San Francisco, Houston, Chicago, Toronto, Denver, and more with more massive showings on the horizon.\n\nDesert Hearts has given rise to a family of tens of thousands and it's safe to say the Love Movement isn\u2019t slowing down anytime soon. Everyone that attends our events is part of our family and who are what makes the tangibly delicious vibe so astronomically good. There is no Desert Hearts without the Family.\n\nHOUSE, TECHNO, & LOVE\u2026 WE ARE ALL DESERT HEARTS.\n\n\n~ \u2665 Location & Weather \u2665 ~\n\nhttps://www.desertheartsfestival.com/pages/directions\n\nThe Los Coyotes Indian Reservation is truly a gem to behold. Tucked in to the mountains surrounding Warner Springs (San Diego County), it brings the best of the high desert and forest together all in one. Trust us when we say we don\u2019t know of a more beautiful place in Southern California to host our festival.\n\nTemperatures can range from the 70s in the day to the 30s at night. Be prepared for extreme heat and cold. There are plenty of open spaces as well as ample areas shaded by trees.\n\nThere will be plenty of parking that is reasonably close to all camping areas. If you wish to bring an RV, you must purchase a pass in advance. If you would like to camp with your car, you must purchase a pass in advance.\n\nThe campground is rustic so there are no showers or functional bathrooms. We will be providing ample portapotties that will be spread throughout the venue.\n\n* * There will be no drinking water supplies, so please bring enough to last you as well as extra to share. * *\n\n\n\n~ \u2665 Musical Offerings \u2665 ~\n\nTBA ~ but you know it\u2019s gonna be dope baby!\n\n\n~ \u2665 DesertARTS \u2665 ~\n\nDH Arts Program aka DesertARTS was founded to provide a structured management platform for the involvement of community based artists and performers to create a truly unique atmosphere embedded with artistic participation and imagination. \n\nArt and dance are the ultimate form of self expression and it is through these platforms that we celebrate all that make us human. With the growth of Desert Hearts we have continued to focus on the expansion of our arts and outreach for community participation. We have fully committed to hosting a wide variety of artists, which include but not limited to, live painting, face/body painting, displayed art, interactive art, art installations and performance art.\n\nFor Questions, please email art@deserthearts.us\n\n\n~ \u2665 Yoga and Healing Sanctuary \u2665 ~\n\nBeing a boutique festival that's focused so heavily on the music and vibe, we at Desert Hearts are now more than ever committed to creating space for community healers to gather and share their knowledge.

Please only make posts related to ride shares on this group.\n\nFacebook Group:\nhttp://bit.ly/DHRideShare\n\n\n~ \u2665 Creative Participation \u2665 ~\n\nAny creative energy you can bring to the gathering please do! Have some cool deco for your camp? Have some tripped out clothes or costumes? Have any paintings or art sculptures? Like to dance like never seen before? Well this is the place to do it! Let you're creative genius flourish because that is what makes us so beautiful and unique. \n\n\n~ \u2665 Rules and Regulations \u2665 ~\n\nWe are an open community where you can experience freedom in many ways however we have a few rules you must follow when attending Desert Hearts:\n\n~ ABSOLUTELY NO ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES OR ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR OF ANY KIND. Including NOS tanks, balloons or any kind of drug use. Desert Hearts has a strict Zero Tolerance policy. You will be asked to leave if you violate this.\n\n~ 21 & Up Event; ID's will be checked at the gate.\n\n~ No re-entry if you leave the festival. Bring enough water and ice to last you throughout the weekend--they will not be sold or provided on grounds.\n\n~ No dogs (service dogs excluded, but must be identified and leashed).\n\n~ No renegade sound systems--basically anything larger than a small speaker. One stage, one vibe has always been our policy.\n\n~ No littering, especially be mindful of bottles and cigarette butts. Do your part to help clean up trash when you see it.\n\n~ Pack it in and pack it out please!!! When you leave trash at the campgrounds it puts a lot of strain on our volunteer team.\n\n\n~ \u2665 Leave No Trace \u2665 ~\n\nThis is a leave no trace event. Pack it in, pack it out. Please do not leave your trash bags with us.\n\nPLEASE do not leave any bottles or trash by the dance floor/speakers. If you see trash or bottles out on the ground or left out, please help clean it up and keep our land beautiful. There will be recycling containers by the stage.\n\nIt's a good idea to bring two trash bags, one for trash and one for recycling. Please pocket your cigarette butts and pick up any butts if you see them on the ground. No glow sticks or glow sand please! Also, please no feather boas or anything that will create MOOP.\n\n\n~ \u2665 Safety and Security \u2665 ~\n\nDesert Hearts will be staffed with a fully licensed and insured security team at all times.

If you have any medical needs please find the medic tent and they will be more than happy to service you. Please be cautious of any known allergies, illnesses, or infections you may have.

It does not matter if you are a high level freeflyer with thousands of jumps, or if you have just received your A-license and are looking for the best way to learn solid freefly & skydiving fundamentals, Flajflaj is a camp for you!\n\nThe foundation of Flajflaj is a very high coach to student ratio. This makes it possible for the coaches to give a lot of attention to each individual participant, ensuring that no one gets left behind. We also have full time staff on the ground who are making sure that you are always in the group best suited for your needs. This is NOT a boogie where you have to lurk around to find people or organizers to jump with!! We always have great canopy coaches on staff, to make sure we never lose focus on this very important aspect of skydiving.\n\nAs always Flajflaj will take place at skydive Elsinore and we will jump from their two twin otters and two Cessna caravans (plus the occasional balloon:). The camp runs Mondays through Fridays (first Sunday evening has the opening meeting at the DZ) and most people take the weekend off to rest and do some sight seeing in California. If you\u00b4d rather stay at the DZ and get more jumps in you are more than welcome to do so. Flajflaj is made to be flexible and we always try to listen to what the participants want to do. If you want to take a break you take a break, if you want to go hard you go hard.

Once again they will be touring without a support act, performing two career spanning sets (separated by an intermission). \n\nAs with the previous tour, this run is largely comprised of theater shows, making for some of the most intimate performances the band has presented in years. The awe-inspiring live visuals, designed by the same team behind their previous Knights of Illumination award-winning tour, have been met with universal praise, pairing with the emotional heft of the music to create a wholly subsuming experience.\n\nSELECT PRESS QUOTES FROM 2016 NORTH AMERICAN TOUR\n\u201cEngaging with the band is often like watching an iceberg slink slowly across frigid water, then see bits of it explode. Hearing the group\u2019s songs is to understand yearning.\u201d - SEATTLE TIMES\n\u201cThere were moments when I had tears in my eyes from the beauty of the experience. Sometimes it was a light beauty, sometimes dark, but it was impossible to be in that auditorium and not feel moved.\u201d - TINY MIX TAPES\n\n\u201cSigur R\u00f3s used their music to sooth, challenge, and uplift those in attendance at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre last night, showing that over 20 years in, they remain a group who are true to themselves, giving so much to fans in the process.\u201d - EXCLAIM\n\u201cSigur R\u00f3s is more than a band, it is a memory palace.\u201d - MOUNTAIN XPRESS\n\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to see Sigur R\u00f3s at the Santa Barbara Bowl on Friday, April 7, 2017. Tickets range from $45.00 to $99.00, plus applicable service charges. The Santa Barbara Bowl is located at 1122 N.

We are in solidarity with thousands of First Nation Peoples and Billions of people across the world resisting choices not representing the public. The Dakota Access Pipeline, Oceti Sakowin prayer gatherings, and mass bank divestment, are microcosms of systemic corruption.

He declares to his friend Colonel Pickering that in three months he could transform Eliza into a duchess.\n\nOver the course of several months Eliza, who moves into the Higgins household, is put through a gruelling course of phonetics and elocution lessons by Higgins. Eliza's moment of triumph comes at the Embassy Ball. She is beautiful, elegant and well-spoken and proves to be an enormous success particularly with the young gentleman Freddy Eynsford-Hill who falls desperately in love with her.\n\nAfter the ball Eliza falls into despondency as she sees Higgins celebrating his triumph in passing Eliza off as a duchess, showing little consideration for her feelings. Unnoticed, she slips out of Higgins' house and seeks consolation with Higgins' mother.

These are the northern elephant seal, harbor seal, Steller's sea lion, California sea lion, and the northern fur seal (the last of which, like the Rhinoceros Auklet, began to return to the island again after protection).\n\nAs part of the Fish and Wildlife system, the Farallon Islands are an important reserve protecting a huge seabird colony. The islands' position in the highly productive California Current and Eastern Pacific upwelling region, as well as the absence of other large islands that would provide suitable nesting grounds, result in a seabird population of over 250,000. Twelve species of seabird and shorebird nest on the islands; Western Gull, Brandt's Cormorant, Pelagic Cormorant, Double-crested Cormorant, Pigeon Guillemot, Common Murre, Cassin's Auklet, Tufted Puffin, Black Oystercatcher,Rhinoceros Auklet, Ashy Storm-petrel, and Leach's Storm-petrel.\n\n\n\n* These exclusive trips explore and explain the natural history of the Great White Shark and other local species.  We will linger near the island searching for shark predation or other signs but we cannot attract sharks nor is this a shark trip. Although it is highly likely we will see many amazing species of wildlife, there is NO GUARANTEE of seeing sharks, whales or other specific wildlife. This is Nature- but lucky for us there is a lot of it out there and we have never been disappointed. This is not a Shark Viewing trip, but a shark conservation and wildlife appreciation experience. As wildlife viewing and timing allow we may visit the Continental Shelf to view pelagic species!\n\n\n\nDeparture\n\n Please join us on the Vessel by 0730 to begin boarding  for an 0800 departure.\n\nThe boat cannot wait for latecomers. We will go out in fog, light rain or small craft warnings (very unusual this time of year) at the captain's discretion but the boat needs to leave on time. We will return to the Bay about 4:00-4:30 p.m. Allow for delays, especially if unusual wildlife is encountered. Trips may be truncated or rescheduled if weather conditions deteriorate. See departure and refund details below.\n\nWeather &amp; Trip Rescheduling\n\nAlthough this is the best time of year to cross the Gulf, weather can be a problem outside of the San Francisco Bay. Light rain or fog generally do not result in cancellations. Decisions regarding cancellation may be made on the morning of the trip in unusual conditions, or the evening before based on the most current weather report. We will make our best estimate of weather conditions the evening before and if conditions warrant a cancellation may be made. Notification will be provided via Universe.\n\n Call into 415 350-3790 for a recorded message at 8:00 PM the evening before. We will make every attempt to inform you by email or this site beforehand but cannot personally contact the entire passenger list by telephone. \n\nFor passenger safety and comfort, once the vessel has left the Golden Gate routes up or down coast will be determined by the Captain. If conditions deteriorate this may be a coastal trip and the Gulf will be crossed at the Captain's discretion. There is still plenty of wildlife viewing at Drakes Bay or Pacifica in more sheltered waters. No refunds can be given once the boat has left the dock.\n\nRefunds &amp; Changes\n\nThe captain and operator will make the determination to depart, generally the evening before based on the current forecast. Trips may be canceled in advance due to undersubscription, hazardous weather conditions, Acts of God or emergency. If the trip is canceled for any of these reasons, we will honor your ticket on another trip.  If desired, you will receive a refund, less a $15 processing fee, within 30 days of cancellation.\n\nAn advance refund is allowed if received by email or through Universe  within 7 days of the departure date. You must have confirmation for the return to be valid minus a $15 processing fee for each canceled reservation.\n\nCancellation within 7 days of the scheduled departure time cannot be refunded. You will have the option to attend a trip at a later date at no penalty provided there is space. Due to scheduling we cannot accommodate repeat scheduling changes. We will honor your reservation for one year from date of first booking with 7 days advance notice.\n\nIn no event shall our liability exceed the obligation to refund more than the amount you paid to us. If you should miss your trip due to airline changes, cancellations, terrorist acts, acts of war, or related incidents, your fee will not be refundable. There are no exceptions to this policy.  Once the boat has left the dock, no refunds can be given.\n\nSafety and Access\n\nBoarding requires climbing up and down a six foot ladder.  The vessel cannot safely accommodate wheelchairs or persons on crutches  or persons with mobility problems due to conditions at sea.  Special accommodations may be made at the Captain/Owner's discretion but advance notice is required.  The vessel is equipped with all required US Coast Guard life safety equipment including communications, fire extinguishers, first aid and man overboard equipment. For your safety, persons with leg or other injuries, immobility or pregnancy are discouraged.\n\n* Note- this is a wildlife experience. Although it is highly likely we will see many amazing species of wildlife, there is no guarantee of seeing sharks, whales or other specific wildlife. This is Nature. This is not a Shark Viewing trip, but a shark conservation experience.\n\nContact the organizer for more details or questions.\n\nThis is a long day in the elements. Young children and babies are not allowed by the Captain. Youth over 10 accompanied by parents are encouraged! Please consult with us for making a reservation for anyone under the age of 10 years.\n\nSea SicknessThe Gulf of the Farallones can have rough waters.

        "description": "FACE X Public Works Present:\n\n2ManyDJ's\n\n+ Eug\n\n+ in the Loft\nVin Sol ( Soo Wavey / Club Lonely )\nB\u00e9zier ( Honey  Soundsystem )\nGuillaume ( Spring Theory )\n\nFunktion One sound\n\nFrom politically incorrect prog-rock to funky r&b, from trendy hiptrop to banging German techno, ja: if it gets a booty going, the Dewaele brothers have it in their record collection.\n\nIn times where moms give their sons and daughters DJ-courses for their birthdays and bootlegging has become an Olympic sport, it is nice to see a record that sets a new standard in the genre of mix-albums: '2 Many DJ's' from Belgian groove-gurus Soulwax.\n\nFans of quality left-of-centre rock music will know Soulwax from their highly acclaimed album 'Much Against Everyone's Advice', which made it into the British Top 40 and got rave responses in Japan and Australia. But there's much more to the two brothers than meets the eye. Apart from being chairman of the Belgian Carpenters Association (Stephen) and having a black belt in tae kwon do (David), they are also masters in blending the finest products of music history together into a catchy, hilarious and -above all- intriguing groove exploration. From politically incorrect prog-rock to funky r&b, from trendy hiptrop to banging German techno, ja: if it gets a booty going, the Dewaele brothers have it in their record collection. \n\nBlending beautiful tunes is far from new for the Soulwax brothers. Back in the dark days of 1999, David and Stephen started a DJ-show on Belgian national radio, called 'Hang The DJ', where they did exactly that. Years before bootlegging reached the trendy pages of The Face, they were already making their own mixes for inclusion on the show. Inspired by the philosophy of one Grandmaster Flash, they cut together the best bits of funky tracks into an even funkier mix. It was then that classic mixes of Blackstreet with Grandmaster Flash, Beck with Prodigy and Beastie Boys vs. Herbie Hancock with INXS vs. AC/DC saw the light of day. Praise the Lord.\n\nAfter having wooed Belgian and Dutch crowds for a few years with these eclectic sets, they went on to impress the most cynical part of the world, the London scene, a loud yet harmless species. The British capital, where approximately 67% of the population (including 17% of women over 65) owns two decks and a mixer, is used to a thing or two, but Stephen and David immediately raised quite a few eyebrows with sparkling sets for London's independent radio station Xfm, national institution BBC Radio 1 and appearances at the renowned Trash nights in London and Arthur Baker's Sunday Sessions in The Elbow Room.\n\nImpact on the trendometer: a fat 9.5. \"When we played our first set for Xfm\", says David, \"several club owners phoned up during the transmission to ask us to come and play their venues.\" And when an (unnamed) DJ played Soulwax's classic bootleg mix of Skee-Lo's 'I Wish', Survivor's 'Eye Of The Tiger' and The Breeders' 'Cannonball' at a London club night and pretended he was mixing it himself, it became official: Soulwax was hot property. Even Jarvis Cocker showed his appreciation for their skills and none other than \u00fcber-producer Felix Da Housecat invited the brothers to collaborate on his new project: a girlband called Glamarama. You gotta believe it\u2026\n\nNo surprise then that '2 Many DJ's' has been in the pipeline for yonks, but because getting tracks cleared is a legal war zone, it has taken quite a bit longer. \"Mick Jones from The Clash was very impressed with our bootleg version of their 'The Magnificent Seven' mixed with Basement Jaxx's 'Romeo'\", explains Stephen, \"but still we didn't manage to secure the rights to include it on the album\". Rumours that two lawyers have been decapitated since are unconfirmed.\nToo bad, but there's more than enough magic material to keep you intrigued, smiling and shaking. The record includes already renowned mixes like Destiny's Child's 'Independent Women' with 10CC's 'Dreadlock Holiday' and Stooges' 'No Fun' with Salt 'N' Pepa's 'Push It', but it also features new beautiful blends like R\u00f6yksopp's 'Eple' with Dolly Parton's 'Nine To Five' and Basement Jaxx's 'Where's Your Head At' with Emerson Lake & Palmer's 'Theme From Peter Gun'. \n\nTongue-in-cheek is the first thing that springs to mind when reading these names, but if you peel off the first, obvious layer, you have to admit that these 'cheesy' mixes actually do work. Mixing 45 songs together in one hour of music is one thing. But making that hour a consistent exploration of the history of pop music is quite another. '2 Many DJ's' makes you laugh, yes indeed, but it also covers left, right, top and bottom of groovy pop. Some of the tracks on this album are obvious classics, some are simply unknown and some will very soon become hot sought-after gems. From Japanese geisha Hanayo covering 'Joe le Taxi', 21st century proof electro from Adult., Finnish disco from Ural 13 Diktators or sleazy Peaches to classics from The Velvet Underground, The Breeders, The Residents, Sly And The Family Stone and Nena. They're all there for a reason. \n'2 Many DJ's' proves that 'genre' has never been such a naff word.",

        "description": "Elton John and his band return to Tucson for one performance at Tucson Arena on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 at 8 PM as part of an 11-city concert tour that will feature iconic hits and classic album tracks from throughout his incredible five-decade career, as well as selected tracks from his latest release, Wonderful Crazy Night.\n\nThe public on-sale will begin Monday, December 5 at 10 a.m.\n\n\u201cThe simple truth is I want to spend more time with my family and less time touring,\u201d said Elton. \u201cI am all too aware of how precious the time ahead is. My sons are growing up so quickly. Their early years are just flying by and I want to be there with them\u201d.\n\nElton John\u2019s band features Nigel Olsson (part of Elton\u2019s original three-piece band) on drums, Davey Johnstone (who first recorded with Elton in 1971 and joined the band a year later) on guitar, John Mahon on percussion, Kim Bullard on keyboards and Matt Bissonette on bass.\n\nOne of the most successful artists on the road today, Elton and his band perform a concert you will never forget: the entire audience singing along to much-loved classic songs such as \u201cYour Song\u201d, \u201cRocket Man\u201d, \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d, \u201cPhiladelphia Freedom\u201d, \u201cCrocodile Rock\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me\u201d, and many more.\n\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to welcome back Sir Elton John to the Tucson Arena for what will be an incredible performance,\u201d said Glenn Grabski, General Manager of the TCC.\n\nThe monumental career of international singer/songwriter and performer Elton John spans five decades. He is one of the top-selling solo artists of all time with 38 gold records and 31 platinum albums, 29 consecutive Top 40 hits, and he has sold more than 250 million records worldwide. John holds the record for the biggest selling single of all time, \u201cCandle in the Wind \u201997,\u201d which sold over 37 million copies. Since launching his first tour in 1970, he has played over 4,000 concerts worldwide in more than 80 countries to his credit.\n\nBuy tickets at the Tucson Convention Center Ticket Office any Ticketmaster locations, www.ticketmaster.com or charge by phone 800-745-3000. Two hours prior to event tickets must be purchased at Tucson Convention Center Ticket Office.\n\nWe can only guarantee the authenticity of tickets bought from our box office or ticketmaster.com.\n\nFor additional information please call 520-791-4101 X 1.",

They had hits on the radio, toured constantly and appeared in television shows and movies such as 10 Things I Hate About You.

They've toured the US with Swim Deep, and now they're touring the West Coast and Southwest this spring with Save Ferris. Vista Kicks' music is a fast blend of good ol' Rock N' Roll, Funk, and Pop. Their shows are electric, they make impossible not to dance and have a great time.",

        "description": "\"One of the best live soul bands I have ever seen!\" \u2013 Al Bell (Record producer, songwriter, executive, and co-owner of legendary Stax Records)\n\nRaised amid the rich musical culture and history of the San Francisco Bay Area, Monophonics proudly carry the torch through the generations into today's musical landscape. Holding on to tradition, but by no means purists of any kind, they play their own brand of music known as \"Psychedelic Soul.\"\n\nThe 2012 release of Monophonics last album In Your Brain saw the band pulling influences from such acts as early Funkadelic, Sly and The Family Stone and the The Temptation's Norman Whitfield produced records. With the new album, Sound of Sinning (out now on Transistor Sound Records), the band has grown in all areas of record making and felt a need to explore other important influences. While the group has come to cherish these inspirations, with Sound of Sinning they started venturing beyond, to the groups that were inspiring those soul acts to embrace the psychedelic sound of the 60's and 70's. Bands such as The Zombies, The Beatles, Beach Boys and Pink Floyd. Even with the experimentation of new musical territory, they display the sound that people know and love about Monophonics. Touching on Northern soul, doo-wop, rock and roll, Psych pop, and cinematic music, Monophonics show off their diversity while remaining true to their roots. Overall it's heartfelt music and old school vibes, without losing sight of the present. This is music steeped in that timeless feeling when people could write and produce songs that you could listen to over and over again. Sound of Sinning was produced by Kelly Finnigan & Ian McDonald and recorded on an old Tascam eight-track 1/4\" tape machine at Transistor Sound Studios in San Rafael, CA.\n\nMonophonics is Austin Bohlman (Drums), Myles O'Mahony (Bass/Background Vocals), Ian McDonald (Guitar/Background Vocals), Ryan Scott (Trumpet/Back- ground Vocals/Percussion) & Kelly Finnigan (Keys/Lead Vocals) along with a rotating 2nd horn usually filled by Nadav Nirenberg (Trombone) from Ikebe Shakedown and Breakdown Brass.",

I do however require that you are comfortable in the water. Its a great time, and a hidden gem. Come  eat, come drink, come play. The cost of this trip is around $200 but worth every cent. There are very limited spaces. Please invite others who you think would be interested in such an event. For more information check out www.saltysound.com.",

Learn how to get - and stay - on a \nroll\n\n\t\n\n\t Getting in the zone requires that you take charge of your immediate\n\nenvironment to the degree that you can, as often as needed. You might\n\nfind that stress comes largely from the feeling of not being in control.\n\n There's something about taking control of your immediate environment\n\nthat enables you to get the best from yourself, to work with your\n\ninternal rhythms, and to produce superior results more easily and\n\neffortlessly.\n\n\tAs often as possible, you want to work with your internal rhythm so\n\nthat you get the best of yourself, while minimizing the wear and tear of\n\n working.  For example, any time you've been seated at your desk for\n\ntwenty minutes or so, it's best to get up and stretch, even if only for a\n\n few seconds. Your veins and your heart need this.\n\n\n\nIf you feel that your office and the surrounding technology is\n\ndeleterious to productivity and personal balance, let any disturbances\n\nhereafter serve as a reminder that while you can't control everything,\n\nthere are ways to turn situations to your advantage.  When you\n\ncreatively carve out sanctuaries for yourself, they give you both the\n\nquiet you need to get quality work done, and serve as a reminder that\n\nyou're in charge of your career.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you Attend: \n\n Being in the zone means that you get so much accomplished, or what\n\ntranspires flows so freely, that seemingly many more hours have past\n\nthan actually have. Would it be useful for you to know how to get into\n\nyour zone on a more consistent basis and achieve high productivity day\n\nafter day? You bet it would\n\n\tBeing in the zone occurs when you are not conscious of your output or\n\nresponsiveness in relationship to fixed time intervals, such as an hour.\n\n You can increase the likelihood of experiencing a favorable \"zone\"\n\neffect by removing yourself from the time measured environment - such as\n\n hiding the clock. This is why jotting notes while sitting on a park\n\nbench, in an airplane, or on your back porch, often yields greater\n\noutput than anticipated or accomplished during the same interval while\n\nat a desk in a traditional office. One hour of uncluttered thought can\n\nyield more benefits than days of common desk work.\n\n\n\nIf you want to get in the \"zone\" faster and easier and be your most\n\nproductive self, this program is definitely for you. Jeff Davidson has\n\nknack for helping career professionals accomplish more every day,\n\ndelivered in a lively, compelling, humorous, and down-to-earth style.\n\nDon't be surprised if you feel as if Jeff is talking to you from right\n\nacross the table Jeff will impart the insider knowledge and crucial\n\nobservations he has amassed over the years to help you become master at\n\ngetting in the zone and achieving high productivity.\n\n\n\nAreas Covered in the Session:\n\n\n\tHow to re-create your own 'zone'\n\tCapitalizing on opportunity\n\tUnderstanding \"Flow\"\n\tUsing elements of your environment to support your questions\n\tFacing challenges at odd hours\n\n\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\n\n\tSupervisors\n\tManagers\n\tExecutives \n\tTrainees\n\tNew Recruits\n\tTemps \n\tTeam Leaders\n\tTram Managers\n\tTeam Sponsors\n\tProject Staff\n\tProject Manager\n\tProject Directors\n\n\n\tInstructor:\n\nJeff Davidson, the Work Life Balance Expert\u00ae,\n\ncan move an audience like few others.

        "description": "\n\t\n\tOverview: \n\t \n\t  During a significant change like a merger or acquisition, listening, \narchitecting and integrating both cultures is critical for maximizing \nthe value of the deal. Organizations that thrive in today's complex \nbusiness environment benefit from dynamic, robust cultures.\n\n\t\n\n\t It's common knowledge that mergers often fail or fall short of\n\nrealizing expected value due to complications during cultural\n\nintegration. When surveyed, many CEOs reported that they had no plan in\n\nplace for integration and even if they did, they wished in hindsight\n\nthat they'd had devoted more time and resources to cultural integration.\n\n\n\nWhy do we continue to perpetuate a problem we can solve? Bain Consulting\n\n reported that based on the survey data and anecdotal conversations with\n\n CEOs, executive leaders often don't know what to do when they need\n\naddress cultural integration. Cultural integration and cultural change\n\nare deemed \"fuzzy\" right brain areas that most action oriented, results\n\ndriven CEOs were challenged to address.\n\n\n\nYet successfully integrating the cultures of two different companies\n\nmatters because culture is a significant organizational driver, both\n\npositively and negatively. What's hardest to see, quantify or examine\n\noften holds the most power in an organization. Culture can encompass how\n\n companies communicate, how people and teams relate, how conflict is\n\nhandled, organizational beliefs, mindsets, emotions, and how events are\n\ninterpreted \u2013 all of which influence how problems are solved and\n\ndecisions are made.\n\n\n\nOn the quantitative side, 83% of mergers fail and 50% of leaders are\n\nterminated when these change initiatives fail to produce value. In fact,\n\n a 2011 global survey conducted by Aon Hewitt uncovered that\n\nunsuccessful cultural integration was the number two driver of deal\n\nfailure. The number one driver of deal failure was\n\n\"integration/implementation took longer than expected\" which in and of\n\nitself is adversely impacted by unsuccessful cultural integration.\n\n\n\nWithout successful integration, likely outcomes include:  mediocre, at\n\nbest, decisions, problems solved with band aide solutions, and the exit\n\nof good talent. And the bottom line value of the deal is adversely\n\nimpacted.\n\n\n\nWhen faced with a \"right brain\" issue, such as culture, companies often\n\ntry to create a linear \"left brain\" process to make addressing the\n\nissue.  Here's the problem with that: It doesn't typically work in\n\nimplementation or it doesn't work thoroughly enough over the long term.\n\n Ideally any problem would be solved using both our linear, analytical\n\nleft brain and our creative, intuitive right brain. Cultural integration\n\n is no different. Because culture is often rooted in the unspoken, the\n\nbelieved, the unintentional and the symbolic, it deserves plenty of\n\nright brain creative attention.\n\n\n\nDuring the webinar, we'll discuss a five step Cultural Integration\n\nDesign process that helps two different companies come together to form a\n\n culture that works together well. By executing this five step process,\n\nexecutive leaders retain and increase the value of their business during\n\n a merger or acquisition. The method includes these five steps: Cultural\n\n Intelligence Assessment, Cultural Profile, Cultural Architecture,\n\nDesign &amp; Prototype, and Integrate &amp; Train.\n\n\n\nWhy should you attend: According to a Deloitte\n\nsurvey, 43% of CFOs named post-deal integration a top concern.  A 2004\n\nMercer survey revealed that 75% of executives cited \"harmonizing culture\n\n and communicating with employees\" as the most important factors for\n\nsuccessful post-merger integration.\n\n\n\nA 2011 global survey conducted by Aon Hewitt discovered that\n\nunsuccessful cultural integration was the number two driver of deal\n\nfailure. The number one driver of deal failure was\n\n\"integration/implementation took longer than expected\" which in and of\n\nitself is adversely impacted by unsuccessful cultural integration.\n\n\n\nAreas Covered in the Session:\n\n\n\tUnderstand the definition of culture and its role in your organization's success or failure\n\tDiscuss key principles to assessing, influencing and designing culture\n\tReview a five step process for successfully integrating culture during a merger, acquisition or any significant change\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\n\n\tC-Level Leaders\n\tSenior Leaders\n\tSenior Managers\n\tProject Team Leaders\n\n\n\tInstructor:\n\nClaudette Rowley As an executive coach,\n\n consultant and trusted advisor, Claudette has over 15 years of\n\nexperience working with clients both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nClaudette has a specialty in providing coaching to leaders and managers\n\nas well as training and facilitating teams in corporations on\n\ncommunicating for results and strategic organizational change.

Thank you\n\t\n\t{About Vegan Supper Clubs}\n\t\n\tWe host a monthly themed Vegan Supper Club in our second level loft kitchen.\n\t\n\tWhat's a Supper Club you ask? Think of it as an informal dinner party meant to encourage guests to mingle, share and celebrate food. Events are 19+, complimentary sparkling and flat water will be provided. Here's a sneak peak of what to expect or check out our Supper Club Gallery.\n\t\n\tAre they always Vegan? Yes. We want people to feel included in the discussion around food, culture and the arts and feel making these events vegan will allow more guests to participate. We also do special Gluten-Free editions a few times a year.\n\t\n\t{About Urban Acorn LTD.}\n\t\n\tJust like an idea, acorns begin small with the hopes of becoming something big, strong and meaningful. This was the initial push behind Urban Acorn LTD. a Flexiatarian Catering company founded by Chef Daniel Holloway and his partner Marie Fitrion.\n\t\n\tInspired by art, music, and using food as a dialogue for social change, Urban Acorn wants to encourage people to broaden their understanding of food and each other with the hopes of building stronger communities.\n\t\n\tTheir mostly plant-based 'Flexitarian' approach to cuisine, allows them to seamlessly create menus to both omnivores and vegans. Their philosophy is simple, they believe food should unite, not divide people\n\t\n\t\n\t",

As such, it can determine the thermodynamically minimum consumption of hot and cold utilities necessary for the plant, and provide insight into design or retrofit options that may attain these targets. Energy savings ranging from 10 to 30% are typical, even in up-to-date plants that have been subject to conventional energy audit methods, resulting in cost savings, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water savings, and increased production throughput.\n\nINTEGRATION software, an easy-to-use but powerful tool available for free from NRCan, assists in the application of process integration techniques to complex industrial plants with high heat requirements. INTEGRATION also includes modules for quickly evaluating heat recovery opportunities for boilers, refrigeration systems, and compression systems.\n\nDuration: approximately 3.5 hours\n\nParticipants will be given an evaluation version of the INTEGRATION software that they can install on a laptop for use during the course.\n\nFor other free introductory courses, see http://www.rerinfo.ca/RETScreenTraining.html\n",

In our tale, most characters are gender-swapped and the relationships between the classic characters of Nottingham are turned on their heads. The story follows Robin as she conspires with her merry (wo)men to take down the tyrannical Prince Joan and her sadistic sidekick, the Sheriff of Nottingham. Just as things start looking up for our heroes, Robin\u2019s world gets turned upside down and she must learn a valuable lesson about honour and teamwork if she hopes to save her kingdom from Joan\u2019s unlikely rule.\n\nSet to some of the most popular pop, rock and hip-hop songs of the past decade, Robin Hood: Prince of Tease combines circus, the art of burlesque and the storytelling traditions of musical theatre to create an auditory and visual fest. It is a hysterical, over the top and sensual spectacular that will leave the audience on their knees begging for more.\n\nTickets on sale now! Seating is cabaret-style at large and small tables, and is not reserved unless you book a full table for 6.\n\nShowtimes: Wednesday-Sunday, 8:00 pm\n\nAll tickets are general seating, so make sure you arrive early to get the best seats.

Siris was the original goddess of beer in pre-Sumerian mythology.\n\nThe other goal for the festival is to provide a bursary for Kwantlen Polytechnic University\u2019s Brewing Studies program. The bursary will be available to female students, with the intention of helping achieve gender parity in the brewing industry.\n\nSiris is helmed by three Associate Directors: Claire Wilson, Brewmaster  of Dogwood Brewing, Ashley Brooks, Brewmaster  of Big Ridge, and Julia Hanlon, Brewmaster  of Steamworks. In addition to  addressing the festival, all of them will be supplying casks. MC for the event is Nancy More, the first female Brewmaster  in North America and instructor at KPU.   From Julia Hanlon: \". . . this small club . . . needs more members, so that in the future nobody will feel compelled to ask the question about what it means to be a \"female\" brewer.  The Siris Cask Festival and bursary is one step towards this and I am very honoured and proud to be part of this event to help more female brewers join this amazing community!\"\n\nIn keeping with spirit of the festival, the first hour will be open only to women. After that hour, the ticketed public will be allowed in.\n\nSome quick answers to your questions: \n\nWhen, Where, How: April 22nd 2017, at the Cat and Fiddle Pub, 11 am to 5 pm (1st hour open only to women).\nWho are the brewers?\n There are only three craft breweries in BC that have women designated as head brewers, but there are dozens of women working at every craft brewery. We approached almost all of BC\u2019s craft brewers to have their female staff produce casks for Siris. The response was immediate and enthusiastic.\n\nBreweries that didn\u2019t have a woman as an active member of their fermentation staff almost all had women working for them with brewing skills\u2014either attending brewing school or as home brewers, or from working with other breweries in the past\u2014who stepped in and brewed, again with enthusiasm.\n\nFor breweries without the benefit of female brewers in-house, we were able to connect them with female brewers from inside the industry: cicerones, inside staff, account managers, and others who had the skill and love of brewing. In the end, it all came together.\n\nFor an updated list of all the breweries and a short bio of each brewer, please click on this link SIRIS BREWERS BIO'S\n\nSpecial Event Sponsors:\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat do I get with my ticket?\n\nEach ticket includes access to the event, 10oz Tasting Glass, 10 tokens for 4oz tasting (you can use 2 tokens to have the glass filled), Event Program, Entry in to the Door Prize Draws. If you choose the T-Shirt option it will include one Siris Cask Festival T-Shirt in the size you indicate.   Additional tokens will be available at the venue for $2 each.\n\n \n\nWhat do I need to get in?\n\nYou will need to present your ticket in either paper form or on your digital device. 2 pieces of valid ID\n\nFemales only for the first hour?\n\nIn celebrating the women of craft brewing we want to also recognize the female consumers of craft beer with giving them the first hour 11am-Noon with out the male consumers. Event will open to everyone at Noon.\n\nAre you women? Who\u2019s running the show?\n\nNo, we\u2019re a non-profit society that organizes the largest and best-attended cask festivals in BC. We\u2019ve done the behind-the-scenes organizing to get the space and the casks together, but it\u2019s not our show\u2014we are just holding the curtain for the important players, the brewers.\n\nSo are you speaking for the women of brewing?\n\n No. The Women of Craft Brewing don\u2019t need anybody to speak for them. All they need is a place to speak for themselves. As such the TCCFA has only two mandates: to facilitate a great cask festival, and to use ticket proceeds to endow a bursary available to female students at KPU. The rest of the festival is up to the brewers themselves. We\u2019re as excited as anyone to see where they take it. That\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s women-only in the first hour: networking, celebrating, sharing and enjoying great beer.\n\n How much is the bursary? How will it be awarded?\n\t\n\n Our pledge to KPU is set at $1500 for this festival. We\u2019re planning on driving that number higher\u2014as high as we can\u2014through merchandise sales and donations. The award criteria is handled by the finance department at KPU, but the award will go to a female student entering their second year who demonstrates financial need and meets the minimum GPA.\n\n Is that a depiction of Siris in your logo? Isn\u2019t Ninkasi the goddess of brewers?\n\t\n\n It\u2019s actually a stylized image of Innana, the mother-goddess that originated in Uruk. There are no definitively identifiable images of Siris, or indeed of Ninkasi. Siris actually preceded Ninkasi as the goddess of beer and brewing among the Semite peoples and later got folded into Sumerian mythology as a daemon daughter of Ninkasi. We chose Siris because she was earliest, and because there\u2019s a famous brewery named after Ninkasi that we didn\u2019t want to be confused with. Ancient anthropology is fun, but not simple.\nIs the registration/ticket transferable?\nYes. Tickets can be gifted. As long as the ticket can be presented either in paper or digitally everything is fine.\nCan I get Tickets at the door?\nIf the event is not sold out tickets will be available at the door for $45.\n\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\n\nThis\n is a 19 + event. No admittance under the age of 19. We will be \nrequiring 2 pieces of valid ID to enter the venue. If you do not have ID\n you will be turned away and no refund will be provided.\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\nThere\n will be plenty of parking on site and surrounding area. Taxi service is \navailable, public transit is just step from the venue and there are \nseveral services that can drive you and your vehicle home.\n\nWhat is the refund policy?\n\nThe\n registration deadline is January 22nd, 2017. Full refunds are \navailable prior to January 14th, 2017. There will be no ticket sales \nand no refunds at the event. After this date no refunds will be offered.\n To request a cancellation or to make a change please send an email to \ninfo@tricitiescaskfestival.com\n\nIf you have any other questions, please send us a note to info@sirisfestival.com and put \u2018Siris\u2019 in the subject line. We\u2019ll get back to you with an answer.\n\nAre you with media and would like to contact us? Please email media@sirisfestival.com\n",

Having spent the last few yeas touring the globe, playing on every continent cementing his international profile he is not only a highly talented, respected and loved producer but an entertaining and exciting DJ set to take the next decade by storm.\n\nHailing from Poland his musical journey began during his childhood when he became fascinated by electronic dance music at an early age. He spent 3 years learning step by step how to produce music and also spent this time experimenting with different sounds until he found the one he was passionate about. In 2007 he decided that Trance was indeed his one true music love and it was then he focused on creating euphoric and uplifting Trance music encompassing elements of classical music, new age, chill out and even rock music.\n\nAs the years progressed so has the quality of his music and indeed his international profile. His name is now synonymous with labels such as the massive \u201cArmada Music\u201d and indeed Aly & Fila\u2019s world famous \u201cFuture Sound of Egypt Recordings\u201d. The success of his productions lead to him receiving a lot of requests from some of the Worlds top Djs for remixes. Already in his short but successful career he has remixed for 4 Time #1 Dj, Armin Van Buuren remixing his track \u201cComing Home\u201d, Aly & Fila\u2019s massive vocal track \u201cIt Will Be OK\u201d, Dash Berlin\u2019s massive single \u201cTill the Sky Falls Down\u201d and \u201cVast Vision \u2013 Ambrosia\u201d while other remix work has featured on labels such as Subculture, Blue Soho, Arisa Audio and more.\n\nAs already touched on his own recent original production\u2019s such as \u201cWho We Are\u201d, \u201cInto The Dusk\u201d, \u201cAstoria\u201d and previous hits such as \u201cRevolution\u201d, \u201cAdelaide\u201d, \u201cStarships Over Alice\u201d, \u201cTrue Remonace\u201d, \u201cDreamers & Dreams\u201d and \u201cValhalla\u201d have been heavily supported by an always growing and endless list of the Trance DJ Elite inc. names such as Aly & Fila, Bryan Kearney, Roger Shah, Dash Berlin, Paul Oakenfold and Armin Van Buure. It was this support coupled with a very busy tour diary the last few years that saw his global reputation rise and there is nothing to suggest it will stop anytime soon.\n\nHis recent tour schedule has seen Arctic Moon travel back and forth across the world playing in countries such as USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Mexico, UK, Ireland, Holland, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Czech Republic and many more as well as events such as Tomorrowland, Electric Daisy Carnival, TomorrowWorld, Escape From Wonderland, A State of Trance, Luminosity, Culture One and many more. With his diary having exploded containing numerous festival appearances and club gigs in already visited countries as well as some exciting debuts, Arctic Moon is definitely on his way to being one of the biggest artists of current times.\nIndecent Noise:\n\nIndecent Noise is a producer and engineer hailing from Warsaw in Poland. His sound is completely rapt in energetic and melodic trance sounds, which can often use techier sounds to deliver devastating impact. Playing live Indecent Noise fully uses the benefits of technology by using laptop and midi controllers with Ableton Live making his sets special and unique. His fascination of electronic music started at a very young age and at age 7 he was already listening to compilations from Jan Michelle Jarre and Kraftwerk. It was in 2004 he decided to learn how to become a producer himself.\n\nWe fast forward to the present day and Indecent Noise has now become one of the most consistent and hardest working producers and remixers in today\u2019s modern trance world. His skill and ability level have improved enormously since the early days and while most of his most recent work can be found on his own label, his music has also featured on labels such as \u201cArmada\u201d, \u201cFuture Sound of Egypt\u201d, \u201cDiscover\u201d, \u201cFraction\u201d, \u201cSpinnin\u201d and \u201cSubculture\u201d to name a few.\n\nAs well as being an individual artist, Indecent Noise is also the brains and the main man behind \u201cMental Asylum Records\u201d. His label has become well established as a platform for showcasing the best in up-tempo, uplifting, trance and tech trance. The label not only features original and remix work from Indecent Noise himself but also material from his favourite crop of current and new producers. Having amassed over 70 releases to date, the label keeps going from strength to strength. With every release charting highly and gaining support from the majority of the trance elite it is no surprise that the label has branched off into branded club nights and festival stages.\n\nThe last few years have been massive for Indecent Noise. Releases have included tracks such as \u201cTremors\u201d, \u201cHydra\u201d, \u201cCerberus\u201d, \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d, \u201cThe Darker The Better\u201d, \u201cGlitches\u201d, \u201cDaybreak\u201d, \u201cLost In Noise\u201d and \u201cWarsaw 2.0\u201d. Not only an accomplished producer, artists such as Armin van Buuren, Andy Moor, Signum, Markus Schulz, Solarstone, Arctic Moon and more have put his remix skills to great use. This continued production success has lead to a very busy tour schedule. As well as playing countless club gigs across every global continent he also had the privilege of being booked to play at festivals including \u201cTomorrowland\u201d, \u201cEDC Las Vegas\u201d, \u201cEDC Orlando\u201d, \u201cA State of Trance\u201d, \u201cGlobal Gathering\u201d, \u201cLuminosity\u201d and \u201cBurning Man\u201d as well as making regular appearances in Ibiza and for global brands such as Ministry of Sound & Godskitchen.\n\nFollowing on from previous years 2016 will show no let up. Already set aside are new productions and remixes fresh from a brand new studio which was pieced together in the later half of 2015. While constantly touring as an individual artist Indecent Noise continues to push his \u201cMental Asylum\u201d brand to all corners of the globe also with 2015 seen the launch of \u201cMay Goes Mental\u201d. This worldwide tour showcasing the music and the talent on his record label took various artists from the label across 9 cities and 3 continents across the month of May. With near all shows selling out we except this to become an annual concept.\n\nFinally as if being a Dj, a producer and a label boss wasn\u2019t enough, Indecent Noise also has his own weekly radio show which is broadcasted every Thursday, at prime time (9-10pm GMT / 10-11pm CET) on leading online station, afterhours.fm. As well as the radio broadcast you can also sign up and subscribe to \u201cMental Asylum Radio\u201d via i-Tunes.

GST) $45.00+ s/c \n\n-The Zombies Online- \nWebsite: http://www.thezombiesmusic.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thezombiesmusic\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thezombiesmusic\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/ZombiesThe\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thezombiesofficial/\n\nRod Argent and Colin Blunstone, two true stalwarts of classy English pop, have reunited after three decades under the moniker of their former outfit, The Zombies.  Their reunion has been enthusiastically embraced by the public, thanks to a hot band, some superlative new material, and a stage repertoire that draws heavily upon their much-cherished catalogue of Zombies and solo hits.\n \nIn their day, the Zombies were one of the few English bands of the 1960s that enjoyed true global popularity, with two American number ones, chart records throughout the rest of the world, and a deep and lasting affection for their music. For instance, in early 1967, at a time when their career had almost ground to a halt in the UK, the band played to crowds of over 30,000 in the Philippines. And ironically, right after the band split, their final single \u201cTime Of The Season\u201d quickly became their biggest record \u2013 US radio plays for the latter song recently passed the four million mark. The Zombies\u2019 first two American singles, \u201cShe\u2019s Not There\u201d and \u201cTell Her No\u201d, also remain two of the most-heavily spun vintage hits on American classic-rock radio.\n  \nTheir return to the concert stage is of particular importance to fans, since many never had the opportunity to see the band live during its brief existence in the 60\u2019s (especially since a large number of their fans were born after the original line-up disbanded!).  Their live performances were recently captured on a double CD and DVD, Live At The Bloomsbury Theatre (released in the U.S. by Rhino in 2007), and their appearances in North America have included the \u201cLittle Steven\u2019s Underground Garage\u201d and \u201cHippieFest\u201d tours, as well a stint for Rod Argent in the 2006 line-up of Ringo Starr\u2019s \u201cAll-Star Band\u201d.\n \nMarch 2008 marked a true celebration of joining the old and the new, when the current Zombies line-up was joined onstage by the other surviving original members, bassist Chris White and drummer Hugh Grundy, for a series of special concerts at London\u2019s Shepherds Bush Empire, which featured the first-ever live performances of Odessey & Oracle in its entirety.  This momentous event, awaited by many for decades, was filmed for a future DVD release, and was attended by fans ranging from Robert Plant to members of Snow Patrol.\n \nThe Zombies are cited by the mercurial Courtney Love; and as influences by Badly Drawn Boy, Paul Weller, Super Furry Animals, Magic Numbers, Billy Joel, She & Him, Foo Fighters, Fleet Foxes, The Vaccines and the Arctic Monkeys, among others. Recorded for their Golddiggers album, The Beautiful South released their version of \u201cThis Will Be Our Year\u201d as a single. Just recently, Neko Case and Nick Cave recorded \u201cShe\u2019s Not There\u201d for the premier episode of HBO\u2019s \u2018True Blood\u2019 fourth season.  The Zombies\u2019 songs are regularly covered live by such varied artists as Beck, She & Him and Belle & Sebastian, and used in films and TV shows (\u2018Dear Wendy,\u2019 \u2018Awakenings,\u2019 \u2018Kill Bill 2,\u2019 \u2018The Simpson,\u2019 among others \u2013 evidence that their music really is as fresh and relevant today as it ever was.\n \nColin Blunstone\u2026Rod Argent\u2026The Zombies \u2013 two seasoned pop veterans, backed by an exemplary band, with a show that not only pays open tribute to the much cherished highlights of their unequalled musical legacy, but also continues the tradition with new music cut from the same cloth: a treat for pop fans any way you slice it.\n\nStay up to date with Live Nation!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/livenationbritishcolumbia\nhttps://twitter.com/livenationwest\nhttps://instagram.com/livenationbc\nwww.livenation.com\n\nFollow the Commodore Ballroom:\nhttp://www.commodoreballroom.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/commodoreballroom\nhttps://twitter.com/commodorevcr\nhttp://instagram.com/commodoreballroom",

The Poetry Brothel presents a rotating cast of both male and female poets as \u201cwhores,\u201d each operating within a carefully crafted character, who impart their work in public readings, spontaneous eruptions of poetry, and most distinctly, as purveyors of private poetry readings on beds, chaise lounges and in private rooms. For a small fee, all of the \u201cpoetry whores\u201d are available for these sequestered readings at any time during the event. Of course, any true brothel needs a good cover; The Poetry Brothel\u2019s is an immersive cabaret, offering a full bar, musicians, burlesque dancers, painters, actors, and fortune-tellers, with newly integrated themes, performances and installations at each event.\n\nDoors open at 7:30pm; show starts at 8:30pm. Themed costumes and/or evening wear are encouraged but not required. This event is 18+.\n\nFor specific event details, please visit www.thepoetrybrothel.com/events.html.\n",

All fellow crusaders in the fight to prove that electronic music can be so much more than a one dimensional soundtrack for a night on the lash.\n\nThe success of his musical blog 'a few things from Ivan Smagghe' has generated a compilation series of edits for Paris uber-fashion store Colette. The first volume sold out in a couple of weeks. His project with Tim Paris, It's A Fine Line, has already put out numerous remixes (from Superpitcher to the XX) and releases that can't be pigeonholed (electro rockabilly on Kompakt to italo rickety disco on Marketing Music). Their new studio is now fully set for original music, remixes and production.\n\nAside from his A&amp;R role for now 12 years old label Kill The DJ (who have released the first EP of RMVN, Ivan\u2019s project with Roman Flugel), Ivan has also started solo work (a noted remix for Parisian label Meant) as well as more planned collaborations with musical friends (Ewan Pearson and Tiga being first on the list).\n\nYou can catch Ivan subverting the masses on any given weekend, all around the world. Go to http://afewthingsfromivansmagghe.blogspot.com/ for more info, thoughts, and edits.--------------------------------\n\nSaturday March 25th10p-4a, 21+1809 Minor Ave #10\n",

Many thanks to our Community Partner,  OSU-Cascades, for generously providing their Learning Studio for this salon.\n\nAll TEDxBendSalon events share the same characteristics: brevity, opportunities for conversation and heightened interaction between the speaker and audience. And unlike larger annual TEDx events, our salons focus on an issue, even a question that\u2019s of interest. Short and sweet, each event lasts a couple of hours rather than being an all-day affair. Though the salon\u2019s flexible nature allows it to take varied forms, salon attendees always watch a selection of TED Talks, and occasionally a few live speakers, followed by discussions about the ideas. In 2017, we plan to host Salon events that are timely, hinging on a specific topics in the news.\n\n\n\n\tFree\n\n\n\n",

Rhythms and textures drawn from New Orleans funk, 90s club house, 60s salsa and hip\u00adhop all collide and fracture upon one another on their new LP, Jukestone Paradise. Dubbed \"raucous and captivating\" by Okayplayer, their album cuts play like the soundtrack for a ride through Brooklyn\u2019s diverse neighborhoods, where the group's sound materialized. And the Pimps' live experience only takes it higher. Over the past decade, the group's grassroots following mobilized from the underground club scene in New York to sell out historic venues like the Fillmore in San Francisco and showcase at festivals across the US and Europe. With more than 1 million Spotify plays to date, it seems word truly does spread to the wise. And when you pair high\u00adcaliber musicianship with rhythm and groove as universally enticing as it is unconventional, there's no denying the dancefloor.\n\n\nLed by the soulful vocals of Sarah Clarke, Dirty Revival has made their mark on the Pacific Northwest music scene. The unique ensemble delivers powerful original tracks and superbly arranged classics with a resounding presence, delivering passionate performances from dimly lit dive bars to crowded concert halls and open festival skies. \n\nThe dynamic, seven-piece soul outfit shines on stage, and defines influences from funk- and soul-infused icons of the past. Dirty Revival has shared the stages with musical heavy-hitters such as Michael Franti, George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic, Sir Mix-A-Lot, Slick Rick, Nappy Roots and Gift of Gab, and have several multi-regional tours already under their belt.",

Karen Marie \u00d8rsted is stirring up a buzz throughout the global blogosphere these days. Tastemaker media such as Pitchfork, The Guardian and NME wrote about her and she just returned home from CMJ in New York after playing some widely praised shows.\n\nWith no albums out and only 2 online tracks the 23-year- old M\u00d8 recently faced a bidding war, which ultimately led to signing with Sony for the Scandinavian territory. Now M\u00d8 is being pursued by some of the most respectable labels in the UK and US. Scandinavia, it seems, has done it again!\n\nM\u00d8 is spending the fall in the studio, wrapping up her highly anticipated debut album with Ronni Vindahl of Danish producer entity No Wav.\n\nListeners can expect a lush, warm and soulful production, however M\u00d8 brings the Scandinavian cold/cool and a street vibe edge to the songs, which makes for a sonic juxtaposition.\n\nHer unique mix of indie, pop, hip-hop, electro and soul is hella fresh sounding and it genuinely sounds like M\u00d8 is fighting a battle of mixed emotions inside of herself.\n\nThe Guardian named M\u00d8 'band of the day' and hailed her as 'the next Grimes' and having played alongside acts such as Purity Ring and MS MR, it seems like M\u00d8 might just be the next indie act to break through to the mainstream masses.\n\nThere is not much info out there on M\u00d8 who tends to let her music do the talking, but her facebook biography reveals a glimpse of her current state of mind:\n\n\"The snow nation is eating your brain and your young heart \u2013 dark as the apocalypse. So just go perish in the sn\u00f8w. m\u00f8 m\u00f8 m\u00f8 M\u00d8 M\u00d8 M\u00d8\"",

The  tension we accumulate in day-to-day life and the ideas and beliefs we  accumulate about our loved ones or partner can destroys the love and  domestic harmony. It's particularly erodes desire and intimacy we once  felt with our romantic partners. As we stay in partnership the richness  comes from learning how to turn challenges into opportunities for deeper  intimacy. Through small group or family sessions you and your loved  ones/partner will learn how to re-connect to the present moment and  each other, which can literally breathe new life into a romance as well  as our mindsets in daily modern life. These custom sessions  lasts little over 2 hours and are designed to hold the space for  transformation within you and your partner (Romantic partner or family  member).This work is for you if you are interested in:   * Quieting your mind   *  Unlocking your whole body orgasmic potential    *  Awakening your sexual desire    *  Inspired Creativity   *  Ease of Manifestation   *  Dissolving body discomfort or shame around sexuality   *  Relationships grounded in intimacy &amp; connection     *  Being honored and cherished by a romantic partner     *  Cultivating your Feminine and Masculine energy    *  Finding Forgiveness    *  Radiant Beauty    *  A renewable inner well of energy    *  Feeling at home in your body regardless wherever you goThis work is not for you if:    *  You are looking for a magic pill to fix yourself.    *  You are looking for a magic pill to fix your partner.    *  You don\u2019t want to be responsible for transforming your life.    *  You are looking for new sexual techniques to 'get off'.    *  You just want to feel good, without having to feel anything  else.    *  You are attached to what you already know about yourself, or how sex &amp; relationship work.If you or your loved ones booked more than one session, then after  each session a toolkit for the week/homework, a specialized practice  crafted just for you to continue going deeper will be given. feedbacks are encouraged.These sessions can be redeemed in person at Sacred Garden's home studio or on Skype.NOTE: ALL sessions/exercises are fully clothed with no sexual contact.All major credit cards, checks and cash are acceptedClick here for more information about Sacred Garden of Tantra:http://sacredgarden.strikingly.com/",

Think of it as an informal dinner party meant to encourage guests to mingle, share and celebrate food. Events are 19+, complimentary sparkling and flat water will be provided. Here's a sneak peak of what to expect or check out our Supper Club Gallery.\n\t\n\tAre they always Vegan? Yes. We want people to feel included in the discussion around food, culture and the arts and feel making these events vegan will allow more guests to participate. We also do special Gluten-Free editions a few times a year.\n\t\n\t{About Urban Acorn LTD.}\n\t\n\tJust like an idea, acorns begin small with the hopes of becoming something big, strong and meaningful. This was the initial push behind Urban Acorn LTD. a Flexiatarian Catering company founded by Chef Daniel Holloway and his partner Marie Fitrion.\n\t\n\tInspired by art, music, and using food as a dialogue for social change, Urban Acorn wants to encourage people to broaden their understanding of food and each other with the hopes of building stronger communities.\n\t\n\tTheir mostly plant-based 'Flexitarian' approach to cuisine, allows them to seamlessly create menus to both omnivores and vegans. Their philosophy is simple, they believe food should unite, not divide people\n\t\n\t\n\t",

Because after marriage comes dating!\n\n Written &amp; Performed by Anne Marie Scheffler of Second City Toronto, Just For Laughs, The Comedy Network, SPANK! The Fifty Shades Parody, and Caroline's on Broadway\n\nSo you dated badly in your twenties and thirties, and just in the nick of time, you snagged a soulmate and started a family. But now your perfect life has fallen apart- your marriage is over! Did you really just land back on the dating market? What kind of cruel world is this? Do you really need to go through first dates and new lovers all over again? Or is this happening to everybody: sexy confident adults who can have amazing relationships and not be trying to get married and start a family? Cougar town? Utopia? Or just a lot of wine and lingerie? Who are these guys you're dating? A new kind of fun!\n\nAudience Quotes:\n\nExcellent show. Several days later and we're still laughing and imitating Kendra! - J. M.\n\nSuch a great night out! Anne Marie, you rocked it with your incredibly honest, hilarious and poignant take on life after marriage. Thank you for bringing your heart and experience to the stage! - G. P.\n\nSo awesome - so raw, so brave and SO funny!!! - S. C.\n\nShe was unbelievable! - H. S.\n\nGO SEE THIS SHOW!!! You will Not be sorry!!! - B. L.\n\nAnne Marie Scheffler, you and your show are an inspiration to all of us single guys and dolls. Tinder on, Anne Marie. We will always swipe you to the right! - M. W.\n\nYour show is amazing!- M. L.\n\nLast night's performance was fantastic, with a perfect balance of excellent acting, insightful writing, and comedic talent. - S. M.\n\nWe saw MILF LIFE CRISIS last night &amp; our cheeks still hurt from laughing. Anne Marie is a comic genius and incredible woman taking on the challenge of midlife dating (after divorce).\n\nYOU SHOULD SEE THIS IF: You are midlife, separated, divorced, dating, or in a relationship, a young guy with a thing for Hot Mamas, or if you just need a good laugh. - D. B.\n\nAnne Marie's show is the funniest hour you will spend in Toronto with your clothes on. I urge everyone to catch her last show. -\n\nM.W.\n",

Why not take them to an affordable, interactive sketch show created for the very purpose of entertaining your children? How about we offer you a cup of coffee too or, better yet, a mimosa! Parents and guardians: Rec Room is here to save your weekend...and maybe your life.\n\nRec Room, Houston\u2019s newest performance space nestled in the heart of Downtown Houston, introduces GARBAGE ISLAND, a live, interactive sketch performance for children ages 2 - 6. GARBAGE ISLAND premieres Saturday, February 18, at 10:30 a.m. and runs Saturdays through March 11.\n\nGARBAGE ISLAND, written by Abby Koenig and directed by Rec Room co-founder Stephanie Wittels Wachs, is a fun and interactive live show that is both silly and educational. In the vein of children\u2019s sketch shows, such as You Can\u2019t Do That On Television, and The Muppet Show, GARBAGE ISLAND features absurdist humor and improv, as well as audience participation.\n\nGARBAGE ISLAND takes place in a literal garbage dump where off-the-wall characters come to life to solve mysteries using creative and critical thinking skills. There is an underlying message of earth consciousness and rubbish reuse. Local singer-songwriter, Greg Cote, hosts the show as Garbage Man Joe performing original music. Houston actors and Rec Room regulars Dano Colon, Tasha Gorel, and Orlanders Jones, perform as a rotation of multiple characters.\n\nAdditionally, the show features pre-recorded video of puppet performance by none other than Houston\u2019s esteemed puppeteer, Joel Orr of Bobbindoctrin Puppet Theatre.\n\nThe set and costumes are designed using only found materials to further highlight the theme of sustainability. Costumes are designed by Houston Grand Opera costumer, Clair Hummel.\n\nChildren are invited to bring an old toy with them every week that may be used during the performance as an improv piece for the actors. As such, no two performances will be the same and the audience is encouraged to return to see how the show changes each week. Each performance will culminate in a big kid dance party, with Garbage Man Joe and the cast.\n\nTickets are $10 per child ages 2 and above. Children under 2 are free to sit on their parents\u2019 lap. Parents watch for free! Coffee and mimosas available at the bar.\n\nRec Room is located at 100 Jackson St. Metered Street parking is available.\n",

        "description": "\u201cThe power of one person and one instrument \u2013 engaging and exciting in itself. I believe that\u2019s the root of folk music\u201d. \nWith her third album, Apartments For Lovers, Shawna Caspi taps right into those folk roots, stripping away the session musicians and elaborate arrangements of her previous records in favour of a simple, authentic sound \u2013 her solo guitar and voice. The result is a collection of songs that is close-up and honest, showcasing her warm vocals, classically-trained fingerstyle guitar playing, and intimate songwriting in a genuine, powerful way.\n\nOn Apartments For Lovers, Shawna creates delicate, quiet moments that are vulnerable and accessible even when she\u2019s writing about someone else. Her songs are snapshots \u2013 moments that may appear small, but which subtly carry weight and offer greater depth thanks to her well-crafted lyrics.\n\n\u201cSome musicians make songwriting sound less of a craft and more of a life affirming obsession. Caspi\u2019s compositions stand out as beautiful, complex and intricate\u2026\u201d \u2013 NOW Magazine, NXNE preview\n\nFor 15 years, Shawna has been playing the guitar she bought at the Ottawa Folklore Centre, one of Canada\u2019s best loved music stores. This cherished instrument has accompanied her on tour throughout Canada and the United States, where she has played festivals including the Blue Skies Music Festival, the Summerfolk Festival, the Deep Roots Music Festival, and the Ottawa Grassroots Festival. It was also her constant companion as she played on the long haul trains between Montreal and Halifax and between Vancouver and Toronto as part of the VIA Rail On Board Entertainment Program.\n\nWhile she never had one particular musical influence growing up, Shawna found inspiration in a wide variety of independent singer/songwriters as she played and sang her way through the folk music scene. Some of these artists are now her peers, and she has shared the stage with several of her favourites, including Rose Cousins, Jon Brooks, James Keelaghan, Old Man Luedecke, Suzie Vinnick, and Garnet Rogers.\n\n\u201cShawna Caspi has the rare gift of presence that immediately invites audience engagement, from the first strum of her skilled guitar playing to the last exquisite note she sings\u201d. \u2013 Andy Frank, co-founder of Roots Music Canada\n\nFrom cafes, soft-seat theatres, living rooms, festival stages, and yes, even trains, Shawna is making her living singing her stories on tour. She loves the landscapes of her travels and while weaving them into her songs, she has also been portraying them on canvases. Shawna paints one-of-a-kind works of art inspired by the rich scenery she sees and makes them available for sale with her merchandise. Two of those paintings make up the front and back cover artwork for Apartments For Lovers.\n\nShawna\u2019s Canadian folk roots are an intrinsic part of who she is. In fact, Shawna as a solo musician is exactly who she is as a person \u2013 warm, inviting, a storyteller, a traveler, an authentic artist. \u201cAnd at the heart of everything\u201d, she says, \u201cI\u2019m just a really big music fan\u201d.\n",

        "description": "For this two-hour embroidery workshop, artist Dana Prieto will lead an embroidering circle open to anyone who self-identify as women (cis, trans, non-binary, etc.). Women from different ages, social and cultural backgrounds, and professions are all welcome to participate. No previous sewing experience is required. All materials will be provided including: new kitchen cloths, embroidering thread, and embroidering needles. Participants are also welcome to bring their own used or new kitchen cloth, tea towel, or dish towel to embroider. \n\nEmbroidered pieces from this workshop can either be taken home by the participants or donated to Dana's collaborative large-scale textile installation called The Rags Between Us, an exhaustive exploration of rags, kitchen cloths, dishtowels and tea towels donated by family, friends, acquaintances and strangers. The project re-frames and reenacts ordinary cloths into affective materials, actions, and spaces that embody female narratives of alliances and disconnections with cleaning and sustenance. \n\n\n\nDana has hosted and facilitated three embroidering circles where she collaborated with over 100 women to embroider old and new cloths while engaging in a deeply enriching experience, sharing time, labour, and conversations. In each occasion, our old rags and our most dear female relationships and narratives have been our muses of inspiration.\n\nAbout the FacilitatorDana Prieto is an Argentine artist and educator based in Toronto. She completed a BFA in Drawing and Painting at OCAD University.\n\nHer work circles around the mundane through the creation of spaces, images and actions that propose uncanny participatory experiences. Using ordinary materials such as food, litter and kitchen cloths, her projects reflect on both intimate and social-political issues around migration, belonging, gender and power.\n\nShe has participated in several award-winning collaborative projects working within diverse communities in Toronto, Halifax, Buenos Aires, Rawson, Quito and Belize.\n\n\n\nShe is currently coordinating Critical Soup, an interdisciplinary food-art initiative that opens dialogues about the impacts of Canadian extractive companies in Indigenous and Global South territories.\n\nFind out more on her website.\n\nImage: \u00a9 2015 Dana Prieto.\n",

In the words of its maker, Phase IV is \u201ca sort of sci-fi, surrealistic, ecological suspense story\u2026 a confrontation between man and other species \u2013 in this case ants \u2013 over the apportionment and control of the resources of Earth.\u201d\n\nThe screenplay by Mayo Simon (Futureworld) begins when an unknown cosmic event thrusts ants into a rapid evolution, and they develop a true hive mind. A scientific team investigates the strange Stonehenge-like towers and geometrically perfect designs constructed by ants in the deserts of Arizona, as the local human population flees for their lives. Two scientists set up a computerized lab in a sealed dome, and take in a woman fleeing in refuge. As they study the ants, finding ways to communicate with and combat them, they realize that they themselves are the ones under a carefully controlled surveillance.\n\nOstensibly part of the sub-genre of eco-horror films that proliferated in the 1970s, Kingdom of the Spiders (1977), Empire of the Ants (1977), The Swarm (1978), here the approach is arty, cerebral, and continually visually arresting \u2013 an \u201cant art film\u201d. The remarkable close-up ant photography was shot by Ken Middleham, the insect cinematographer of the 1971 pseudo-doc The Hellstrom Chronicle. Phase IV takes that documentary's premise \u2013 that insects will win the battle for global dominance, not mankind \u2013 and dramatizes it in a way that is often disturbingly plausible. Puzzling to an audience that expected more of a Cold War sci-fi scare flick like Them!, and maybe a little less 2001: A Space Odyssey via Cronenberg\u2019s Stereo and Crimes of the Future, Phase IV was destined for cult classic status. Once seen (especially on the big screen!), it will linger, fear and inspire forever.\n\nBreathtaking and chilling \u2013 don\u2019t mess with the ants!\n",

During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album \"Addiction\" in 2014.\n\nThey decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to \"Dubstep\" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album \"Hybrid Distillery\" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director \"Ebola - Delit2fuite\" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.\n\n*Suport*\n\nBoogie T.\n\nMore info TBA\n",

The audience writes anything they want on notecards that the comedians will seamlessly work into a set before your very eyes!  MAGIC!\n\nHost Mean Dave is a Californian comedian from the SF Bay Area with a rock and roll style for any occasion or function. Starting with a background in music, Mean Dave was a musician of many years who found he was a comedian the way Happy Gilmore thought he was a hockey player who found himself to be a golfer. With a manic, intelligent approach to material about modern day life, you will be thoroughly entertained with clean-to-adult humor about a variety of subjects. Mean Dave has performed regularly at San Jose Improv, San Francisco Punchline, LA Comedy Store, Tommy T's in Pleasanton and all kinds of shows and events all over.\n\nJames Barela- Portland comedy stalwart, James Barela, metes out his comedy in a visceral exploration of turbulent sexuality, lurid cautionary tales, Mexican quirks, and psychedelic cosmic wall-banging. The son of a palm reader and a sheet metal worker in Oklahoma, Barela lived in New York City for several years before settling in Portland. Delivered with a teddy bear's likability, James Barela's comedy will bring you into his unique and vulgar perspective.\n\nAlex Gimapapa- A Boston-based comic, Alex Giampapa began performing stand up at 19 and has since come to share stages with industry heavyweights like Bill Burr and Adam Devine. Alex was recently featured in The World Series of Comedy, a national stand up competition. With his unique-but-relatable style and approachable demeanor, Alex manages to make personal material reach audiences aged 9 to 99. Alex won the 4th Grade Francis Wyman Elementary School Spelling Bee and his mother is very proud.\n\nEvelyn Erie Diamond\n\nStephan Massih \n",

Miss Major is a veteran of the Stonewall Rebellion and a survivor of Attica State Prison, a former sex worker, an elder, and a community leader and human rights activist. She is simply \u201cMama\u201d to many in her community. Her personal story and activism for transgender civil rights intersects LGBT struggles for justice and equality from the 1960s to today. At the center of her activism is her fierce advocacy for her girls, trans women of color who have survived police brutality and incarceration in men\u2019s jails and prisons. MAJOR! is more than just a biographical documentary: It\u2019s an investigation into critical issues of how the Prison Industrial Complex represents a wide-spread and systematic civil rights violation, as well as a historical portrait of diverse LGBT communities, told with love and humor, and personalized through the lens of a vibrant and charismatic woman. Through first-person narration and innovative visual story telling, MAJOR! seeks to create a living, breathing history of a community's struggle and resilience, as seen and experienced by those who lived it.At the heart of MAJOR! is a social justice framework that puts the subjects at the center of their story. MAJOR! was produced in collaboration with Miss Major, the film\u2019s participants, and a transPOC Community Advisory Board to ensure that these stories, which are so often marginalized, exoticized, or played for tragic drama, retain the agency and humanity of those who tell them.\n\nPlease visit Miss Majors Circle of Care here:\n\nhttp://www.missmajorfilm.com/circle-of-care.html\n\nWe would like to acknowledge and honour that all of the work we do is currently being done on unceded Algonquin Territory that was never given up and never surrendered.\n\nOCTEVAW: http://www.octevaw-cocvff.ca/\n\n Accessibility note:\n\t The Mayfair does have an accessible entrance.

This means that we are all responsible for creating the spaces we desire, by educating ourselves, each other and ensuring that we are continually engaging in these conversations and creating relationships of support and collective responsibility. While we recognize that no space is exclusively \u201csafe\u201d for anyone, we must collectively work towards mitigating harms.\n\n Queering613 works towards recognizing dynamics of power and privilege that exist within society and which have historically oppressed our communities. We believe that these same dynamics and tensions exist within our own communities and we are working continuously towards addressing these tensions and creating supportive spaces. People participating in our events and dance parties are asked to be aware of their language and behavior and to think about whether these may be harming others. Our spaces are not spaces for explicit or implicit violence, racism, sexism, ageism, transphobia, cissexism, sizeism, fatphobia, sexual harassment, and gender policing, or doing anything to another person without their consent.

        "description": "DescriptionProducing an aesthetically pleasing event that truly impresses seen-it-all attendees can be a daunting task. Adding to the pressure, today\u2019s event designers are expected to incorporate food and beverage, technology, and branding and find innovative ways to play with color, create unique focal points, use lighting to make a space feel more intimate, and select florals that don\u2019t max out the budget. Do you have the creative edge? Or, at a minimum, can you intelligently \u201ctalk the talk\u201d with creative vendors in order to convey your vision?This course you will cover the key principles of modern event design including how to create a design concept that achieves the client's goals, meets their budget, and can be executed in the venue with the time allotted. Implement a wide range of elements into your next design concept, such as floral, furniture, lighting, branded accents, entertainment, technology and others. Identify opportunities for creating custom fabrication pieces that can be unique focal points for guests, which helps to set yourself apart from others.  By the end of the course you will be able to evaluate a venue's challenges and assets that will be incorporated into a design concept, and how to insure you can execute your vision within the time and space available.\n",

        "description": "Organised by STAR in association with UK Theatre, the Society of London Theatre and the National Arenas Association, this workshop is aimed at increasing awareness for everyone involved in ticketing about disability, the law and equality, as well as helping suggest practical solutions and steps for improvement. It\u2019s an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the issues, with a workshop specifically tailored to focus on ticketing.\n\nBackground:A 2014 report by Attitude is Everything revealed the frustration and inequality that customers with disabilities feel when trying to book tickets for entertainment events online. Very often, venues consider that it's better to offer a more personal booking service, usually by phone, but this is potentially discriminatory if some customers are and some are not able to book online. The issues need to be understood and policies and sales processes need to change to meet the needs of customers with disabilities who want to book online. STAR, along with UK Theatre, the National Arenas Association, Attitude is Everything and other industry organisations, are working to encourage this change.\n\nSuitable for:Anyone involved in ticketing - events, venues, ticket agents, attractions - including sales staff, marketing, policy makers and management working in live entertainment venues.\n\nProgrammeThe workshop will help you:\n\n\n\tUnderstand what disability is\n\tUnderstand the difference between disability equality and disability diversity\n\tGain an awareness of legislation relating to disabled people including The Equality Act\n\tUnderstand what is and what isn\u2019t appropriate conduct / terminology around disabled people\n\tUnderstand how to improve access for disabled people \u2013 and why\n\tUnderstand the benefits to your organisation\n\tEstablish non-discriminatory ticketing policies\n\tLearn about evidencing disability\n\tLearn about card schemes such as Hynt, CEA Card and The Access Card\n\nWorkshop FacilitatorThe workshops are led by Nimbus Disability, a consultancy service working across a range of industries providing practical and tangible support in meeting and exceeding legal obligations toward disabled people. Its portfolio of services includes The Access Card, the first scheme of its type in the UK offering a universal and consistent way of disabled people evidencing and communicating their needs to providers quickly and discreetly.\n\nMartin Austin is Managing Director and Founder of Nimbus Disability. Having read Psychology at University he found a career in the information and advice sector advising disabled people of their rights in terms of Social Security and anti-discrimination legislation. He found a passion for finding the fair and reasonable middle ground between the rights of disabled people and the abilities and capacity of service providers. This eventually led to the formation of Nimbus.\n\nMartin is Chair and player for Wheelchair Basketball Club Derby Wheelblazers and has also represented Great Britain in Sledge Hockey \u2013 the Paralympic version of Ice Hockey.\n\nCostThe cost for the workshop per participant is \u00a3150.\n\nThe following benefit from discounted fees:\n\nSTAR Members (incl. members of UK Theatre and NAA that are also members of STAR) \u00a375UK Theatre members that are also registered charities\t\u00a375Other UK Theatre members\t\u00a3100National Arenas Association Members \u00a3100\n\nIf you are a member of one or more of these organisations and do not have the code to be able to book at the discounted rate, please contact info@star.org.uk\n\nAccess\n\n\n\tParking is adjacent to the venue with dedicated accessible spaces. There is ramp and lift access to conference rooms and halls internally. Click here for further information. \n\tHearing loop facilities available on request (please check the box when booking your ticket).\n\tShould you have any other specific access / dietary requirements there is an opportunity to let us know when registering for the workshop. We will look forward to making the session accessible to you.\n",

Claire has recently suffered many setbacks but maintains a positive attitude and believes this is the key to living a fulfilling life - despite being burdened with such a deadly disease.\n\nIn honor of Claire\u2019s experience and enthusiasm for life, we created Claire\u2019s Place Foundation, Inc., a charity committed to providing heartfelt help to families affected by Cystic Fibrosis.

Ask about our discount pricing for U.S. military veterans.\n\nLIKE us on Facebook: www.Facebook.com/NYSafetyandTraining\n\nVisit our website: www.NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\n\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings mandates that all workers at major construction sites must have had the OSHA 10-hour Construction Industry safety class within the last five years. DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\n\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\n\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n",

You could see it in the arts, feel it in the air, and hear it in the beat of a drum. This was a land of heroes and sages, dragons and phoenixes, emperors and immortals. Known today as China, this place was once called \"the Land of the Divine.\" Shen Yun brings the profound spirit of this lost civilization to life on stage with unrivaled artistic mastery. Every dance movement, every musical note, makes this a stunning visual and emotional experience you will not find anywhere else. Banned in communist China today, the non-profit Shen Yun is dedicated to reviving 5,000 years of civilization. Experience art connecting Heaven and Earth! Experience Shen Yun!",

Known today as China, this place was once called \"the Land of the Divine.\" Shen Yun brings the profound spirit of this lost civilization to life on stage with unrivaled artistic mastery. Every dance movement, every musical note, makes this a stunning visual and emotional experience you will not find anywhere else. Banned in communist China today, the non-profit Shen Yun is dedicated to reviving 5,000 years of civilization. Experience art connecting Heaven and Earth! Experience Shen Yun!",

Arthur Laurents' book remains as powerful, poignant, and timely as ever. The score, by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, is widely regarded as one of the best ever written. The world's greatest love story takes to the streets in this landmark Broadway musical that is one of the theatre's finest accomplishments. Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is transported to modern-day New York City, as two young idealistic lovers find themselves caught between warring street gangs, the Jets and the Sharks. Their struggle to survive in a world of hate, violence, and prejudice is one of the most innovative, heart-wrenching and relevant musical dramas of our time.",
