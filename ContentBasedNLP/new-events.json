The Poetry Brothel presents a rotating cast of both male and female poets as “whores,” each operating within a carefully crafted character, who impart their work in public readings, spontaneous eruptions of poetry, and most distinctly, as purveyors of private poetry readings on beds, chaise lounges and in private rooms. For a small fee, all of the “poetry whores” are available for these sequestered readings at any time during the event. Of course, any true brothel needs a good cover; The Poetry Brothel’s is an immersive cabaret, offering a full bar, musicians, burlesque dancers, painters, actors, and fortune-tellers, with newly integrated themes, performances and installations at each event.\n\nDoors open at 8pm; show starts at 8:30pm. Themed costumes and/or evening wear are encouraged but not required. This event is 21+.\n\nFor specific event details, please visit www.thepoetrybrothel.com/events.html.\n",

In addition to the live program, there will be a reception with an open bar, light appetizers and a silent auction. VIP guests will enjoy assigned seating and an exclusive backstage meet-and-greet with our storytellers.\n\nAll proceeds will support the 5 Gyres mission to end the global health crisis of plastic pollution, because:\n\n300 million tons of new plastic is produced in the United States each year and less than 10 percent of plastic is recovered for recycling.\n\t\n\n5.25 trillion particles weighing in at 270,000 tons of “plastic smog” pollute our oceans worldwide—and a full 80% of that marine plastic pollution comes from land.\n\t\n\nMore than 600 species are endangered or killed by marine plastic pollution.\n\t\n\nPlastic wreaks havoc on a marine ecosystem dependent on phytoplankton, which produce 70% of the earth’s oxygen and sequester 40% of its carbon.\n\t\n\nA tiny piece of plastic can be one million times more toxic than the water around it.\n\t\n\nFish are eating these microplastics—and we’re eating the fish.\n\n        We've been fighting plastic ocean pollution since 2009, when 5 Gyres began a series of scientific firsts by researching plastic in all five subtropical gyres, as well as the Great Lakes and Antarctica. In 2014, the organization convened eight scientists around the world to publish the first Global Estimate of Marine Plastic Pollution. Our paper on plastic microbead pollution in the Great Lakes inspired a two-year collaborative campaign that culminated in a federal ban, which President Obama signed into law in 2015. This year, we're taking on polystyrene, while continuing to inspire activism through our art, education, science and adventure programs.\n\nThank you to our sponsors Costa, Gold Frame Media, Klean Kanteen, Life Without Plastic, Manduka, Outerknown, Reed's, and The Refill Shoppe.\n",

        "description": "TICKETS ON SALE: DECEMBER 6TH @ NOON PST!\nwww.desertheartsfestival.com\n\n21+ \n\nHello Desert Hearts Family!\n\nWow it's good to be back! I think we can all agree that 2016 was one of the craziest years ever, but it's during this adversity that our Love Movement really shines brightest. The world needs love more than anything else right now and it's been our intention since day one to create as much love and positive energy as possible. We hope you'll join us once again at Los Coyotes Indian Reservation, CA on March 31st - April 3rd for our finest Desert Hearts Festival yet. We've been charging up and we're ready to blow your minds.\n\nThere's a reason the mantra of our movement is \"House, Techno, & Love... We Are All Desert Hearts.\" Every single person who attends Desert Hearts is part of our family. A collective consciousness that we tap into together to create the ultimate vibe. Whether you're contributing a theme camp, workshop, your art, or even just a smile, the more you put in the more you get out. When we all go into Desert Hearts with the exact same intention of creating the most amount of love and positive energy possible, we're able to create a tangible vibe that sets the groundwork for the entire weekend. Vibe is king at Desert Hearts, so bring your A-Game, because we’re all bringing ours.\n\nHouse, Techno, & Love… We Are All Desert Hearts. ♥\n\nLove Always,\n\nYour Desert Hearts Crew\n\n~ ♥ Admission ♥ ~\n\nGates open for General Admission, Friday at 10am. Thursday early arrival passes allow admission Thursday at Noon. Music starts at Noon on Friday and bumps nonstop until Monday at 4pm. Tickets include entrance, camping, and access to all open kitchens, theme camps, & art installations. \n\nFor fastest entry, please print and bring your ticket that will be emailed to you upon purchase. If you can't find the email please check your spam or promotions folder. \n\n* In order to encourage carpooling, an Environmental Impact Fee of $20 will be charged per vehicle. This is intended to greatly help us reduce the amount of traffic entering and exiting the festival grounds. *\n\n\n\n♥ Tickets ♥\n\nGeneral Admission - $200 \nEarly Entry - $60 (Need to also buy a General Admission ticket)\nCar Camping Pass - $80\nRV Camping Pass - $165\n\n\n♥ Car Camping, RV Passes, & Early Entry Passes ♥\n\nIf you are planning to camp in the campgrounds with your vehicle, you will need a Car Camping Pass. If you are arriving in a RV or bus, you will need a RV pass or else you will not be allowed entry. If you don't need to camp directly next to your car, there is a huge parking lot about a 2-5 minute walk to the campgrounds where you'll be able to park and leave your car. It is literally the shortest festival walk you'll ever do so don't even trip when Car Camping Passes sell out.\n\nEarly Entry Passes allow entrance to the festival grounds on Thursday before music starts on Friday. If you would like to enter on Thursday you will still need a regular general admission pass as well.\n\n*Note: All cars & RVs will have to pay the standard $20 Environmental Impact Fee upon arrival, even if you bought a Car or RV Camping Pass. \n\n\n~ ♥ About Desert Hearts ♥ ~\n\nOver the past 4 years, the Desert Hearts Family has found itself at the center of a dusty movement, fostering intimate experiences of sonic joy and unbounded love across the globe. Part boutique festival, part record label, and part globetrotting party brigade, this ragtag crew of dreamers has emerged as a vibe-focused force radiating a conscious ethos of House, Techno and Love. \n\nIn November 2012, Desert Hearts began as a 200-person renegade gathering deep in the Mojave Desert, dreamt up by the DH’s founding quintet of Mikey Lion, Lee Reynolds, Porkchop, Marbs, & Kristoff McKay. The intrepid crew barely survived a set of extreme weather conditions and unfortunate circumstances, but that first party sparked a fire. \n\nIn just a few short years what began as a nomadic gathering of friends, has evolved into the darling of the West Coast house and techno scene. Though each edition of the festival may sell out, the DH Crew made the decision to keep the events intimate, ensuring that the love, radical self-expression and positive energy of that first adventure remains at its beating heart. It’s what has attracted world-class bookings like Tiefschwarz, DJ Harvey, Monkey Safari, Rodriguez Jr., DJ T, Claude VonStroke, Marc Houle, Olivier Giacomotto, Mark Henning, M.A.N.D.Y, and many more.\n\n2014 saw the launch of Desert Hearts Records, a totally-free record label embodying the musical sensibility of the movement, while providing a platform to foster established and emerging talent from around the world. Entirely curated by Mikey Lion with Marbs handling the artwork for the label, past releases have included Andreas Henneberg, Latmun, The Glitz, jozif, TÅCHES, Dance Spirit, Fritz Carlton, Kevin Anderson, RYBO, and of course records from the core Desert Hearts Crew.\n\nThe beating heart of Desert Hearts is its founding fathers. A suitably colorful cast of characters, who fell into each other's lives skating and surfing around the beaches of San Diego. Led by top hat sporting label boss Mikey Lion, the core crew is rounded out by ex-pro BMX legend turned DJ, Lee Reynolds, the artistic backbone of the crew, Marbs, Mikey’s younger brother & absolute madman, Porkchop, and renegade visionary Kristoff McKay.\n\nIf the Desert Hearts festival is the epicenter of this movement and the record label its voice, then the roaming City Hearts party series has become the legs that carry this evangelistic cause around the country. A roaming urban distillation of the festival, City Hearts has been sprinkling a little bit of California magic dust across the country and beyond, winning hearts and minds and selling out shows in Los Angeles, New York, Tulum, Mexico City, Miami, San Francisco, Houston, Chicago, Toronto, Denver, and more with more massive showings on the horizon.\n\nDesert Hearts has given rise to a family of tens of thousands and it's safe to say the Love Movement isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Everyone that attends our events is part of our family and who are what makes the tangibly delicious vibe so astronomically good. There is no Desert Hearts without the Family.\n\nHOUSE, TECHNO, & LOVE… WE ARE ALL DESERT HEARTS.\n\n\n~ ♥ Location & Weather ♥ ~\n\nhttps://www.desertheartsfestival.com/pages/directions\n\nThe Los Coyotes Indian Reservation is truly a gem to behold. Tucked in to the mountains surrounding Warner Springs (San Diego County), it brings the best of the high desert and forest together all in one. Trust us when we say we don’t know of a more beautiful place in Southern California to host our festival.\n\nTemperatures can range from the 70s in the day to the 30s at night. Be prepared for extreme heat and cold. There are plenty of open spaces as well as ample areas shaded by trees.\n\nThere will be plenty of parking that is reasonably close to all camping areas. If you wish to bring an RV, you must purchase a pass in advance. If you would like to camp with your car, you must purchase a pass in advance.\n\nThe campground is rustic so there are no showers or functional bathrooms. We will be providing ample portapotties that will be spread throughout the venue.\n\n* * There will be no drinking water supplies, so please bring enough to last you as well as extra to share. * *\n\n\n\n~ ♥ Musical Offerings ♥ ~\n\nTBA ~ but you know it’s gonna be dope baby!\n\n\n~ ♥ DesertARTS ♥ ~\n\nDH Arts Program aka DesertARTS was founded to provide a structured management platform for the involvement of community based artists and performers to create a truly unique atmosphere embedded with artistic participation and imagination. \n\nArt and dance are the ultimate form of self expression and it is through these platforms that we celebrate all that make us human. With the growth of Desert Hearts we have continued to focus on the expansion of our arts and outreach for community participation. We have fully committed to hosting a wide variety of artists, which include but not limited to, live painting, face/body painting, displayed art, interactive art, art installations and performance art.\n\nFor Questions, please email art@deserthearts.us\n\n\n~ ♥ Yoga and Healing Sanctuary ♥ ~\n\nBeing a boutique festival that's focused so heavily on the music and vibe, we at Desert Hearts are now more than ever committed to creating space for community healers to gather and share their knowledge. Our village this year will feature healing domes from Sacred Spaces, Wet Dreams, Earthing Tea and more. Shane Chunephisal (shanechunephisal@gmail.com) has taken lead of organizing and managing our yoga and healing coordination. We will be hosting various forms of healing included but not limited to Yoga, Workshops, Sound Healing, Crystal Healing, Reiki, Energy Work, Spoken Word and Relax/Recharge Zones.\n\nFor Questions, please email workshops@deserthearts.us\n\n~ ♥ Vendors ♥ ~ \n\nFor Questions, please email vendors@deserthearts.us\n\n\n~ ♥ Ride Share Group ♥ ~\n\nJoin our Ride Share group to find a ride or find riders to Desert Hearts. Please only make posts related to ride shares on this group.\n\nFacebook Group:\nhttp://bit.ly/DHRideShare\n\n\n~ ♥ Creative Participation ♥ ~\n\nAny creative energy you can bring to the gathering please do!

Other delightful attractions include a free portrait booth,  vending, mystical and nonsensical oddities, absinthe cocktails, parlour games, alluring sideshows, and much more. \n\nPresented by co-hosts Rosin Coven and Vau de Vire Society, The Edwardian Ball presents a remained world where ballroom dancing leads way to stunning performances both on and offstage in a collage of fashion, theatre, music, circus performance, and dance. Each year, The Edwardian Ball presents a featured Edward Gorey tale in an original stage performance.",

This personal album, containing fifty songs, one for each year of the artist's life, is to be released in early 2017 on Nonesuch Records.\n\nUnlike Stephin’s previous work, the lyrics on 50 Song Memoir are nonfiction, a mix of autobiography and documentary. There is one song per year for the fifty years since 1965. Musically the sound ranges as widely and adventurously as possible, within the context of lyrics-driven music.\n\nIn concert the music will be played and sung by seven performers in a stage set featuring fifty years of artifacts both musical (vintage computers, reel-to-reel tape decks, newly invented instruments), and decorative (tiki bar, shag carpet, vintage magazines for the perusal of idle musicians). The seven performers each play seven instruments, traditional (cello, charango, clavichord) or invented in the last 50 years (Slinky guitar, Swarmatron, synthesizer).\n\nEach performance will be a separate program, so that the whole album will be performed over two nights: \n\nNight One: Songs 1-25\nNight Two: Songs 26-50",

It does not matter if you are a high level freeflyer with thousands of jumps, or if you have just received your A-license and are looking for the best way to learn solid freefly & skydiving fundamentals, Flajflaj is a camp for you!\n\nThe foundation of Flajflaj is a very high coach to student ratio. This makes it possible for the coaches to give a lot of attention to each individual participant, ensuring that no one gets left behind. We also have full time staff on the ground who are making sure that you are always in the group best suited for your needs. This is NOT a boogie where you have to lurk around to find people or organizers to jump with!! We always have great canopy coaches on staff, to make sure we never lose focus on this very important aspect of skydiving.\n\nAs always Flajflaj will take place at skydive Elsinore and we will jump from their two twin otters and two Cessna caravans (plus the occasional balloon:). The camp runs Mondays through Fridays (first Sunday evening has the opening meeting at the DZ) and most people take the weekend off to rest and do some sight seeing in California. If you´d rather stay at the DZ and get more jumps in you are more than welcome to do so. Flajflaj is made to be flexible and we always try to listen to what the participants want to do. If you want to take a break you take a break, if you want to go hard you go hard. It´s your training camp and you spend it the way you want to, but we are always there to help you progress.\n\n\nCoaches, pricing, package and registration:\n\nWe are in the process of signing up coaches and this will take some time to finalize. As always we will have a spectacular lineup of coaches eager to share their knowledge and love for flying. \n\nWe are very happy to announce this short first line up:\n\nAlex Ranström\nAna Aponte\nBJ Michaeli\nClaudio Cagnasso\nDaniel Croft\nDomitille ”Domi” Kiger\nFabian ”Ramsy” Ramseyer\nHeidi Lindewall\nJens \"Light\" Lindblad\nJill Grantham\nJoakim Wetterfors\nKim Törnwall\nLawrence de Lauberde\nLuis Prinetto\nNicolas Rubio\nOde Siivonen\nRafael Schwaiger\nRichard ”Richie” Scheurich\nSharon Har-Noy Pilcher\n\nChris Stewart (Canopy flying)\nJohan Karlsson (Canopy flying)\nRob Heron (Wingsuit coaching)\n\nMany many more coaches will ba announced soon\nStay tuned :-)\n\nAlso ready to serve us are\n\nCarolina Mallwitz (Group coordinator extraordinaire)\nDaniella Martin (Manifest wiz.)\nTomas Almbo (Video editing)\n\nMarie Sjödin. marie@flajflaj.com\nMarius Sotberg. marius@flajflaj.com\nPeter Nilsson. Peter@flajflaj.com\n\n\n\nThe price of Flajflaj is divided in two payments in two currencies and for 2017 it is set to: 2260 usd AND 6950 sek. \n\n(As I am writing this, the total price of Flajflaj in one currency is around 3040 USD, this may vary slightly with the changing exchange rate)\n\nThis fee gets you:\n\nEverything that is Flajflaj, including (but not limited to)\n-50 jump tickets (& a discounted rate for additional jump tickets (23USD))\n-Access to all the coaching & organizing (minimum 10 one on one jumps during week one (if one on one jumps is what you want to do) and A LOT of organized/coached jumps during week 2 (if average group is 3-way, you get minimum 30 jumps with a coach during week 2))\n-Part of a rental car during the entire camp\n-Access to canopy coaching with dedicated canopy coaches\n-Access to team rooms for video debriefing and gear storage\n-Weekly videos (professional editing), T-shirts, Poker tournament entry (included for 2017 with lots of added prices from our sponsors) party's and the freefly experience of a life time!\n\nThe SEK fee needs to be paid within 14 days after registering to secure your slot. Please note that this part of the fee is NON REFUNDABLE. You will always be able to transfer/sell your slot to another person, but since the money will already have been spent on bringing in all the coaches etc. there will be no room for a refund from this part of the fee.\n\nThe USD sum needs to be paid before 2nd Feb 2017\n\nAccommodation\n\nWe have a great relationship with the Lake Elsinore hotel and casino, where most of us will be staying. They offer us a discounted rate of 54USD (tax not included) per two bedded room (27USD per person and night). It´s possible to make arrangements for more people to share one room to keep costs down, but extra beds are not available.\n\nFor 2017 we will have 25 beds available in the DZ bunk house, at 10USD per night. These are available on a first come (read; sign up) first served basis.\n\n(On the registration form you will have to state where you want to stay and in the case of bunk house or hotel accommodation, we take care of the bookings for you as always).\n\nIt is possible to put up a tent (free of charge), rent an RV, or make other arrangements of your liking.\n\nRegistration\n\nRegistration opens 1/10 for everyone who have been to Flajflaj before and one week later, 8/10 for everyone looking to join us for the first time.

With a greywater system, you can divert this water into the garden instead of down the drain.\n\nOne of the easiest systems to install is a Laundry-to-Landscape greywater system. This system benefits your home, garden, community, local ecology and ecosystems, and your wallet. Once installed, it helps conserve and reuse good water everyday, without having to think about it.\n\nSome benefits of a Laundry-to-Landscape system are:\n\n\n\tReduced water consumption (lower water bills)\n\tFree water to feed your garden\n\tReduced pollution on local watersheds and the ocean\n\tReduced energy needs at your local water treatment plant\n\nJoin us to learn how to be a part of the solution with a simple greywater system. In this workshop we will:\n\n\n\tLearn about the difference between clear water, greywater, and blackwater\n\tExplore a few simple and common types of home greywater systems\n\tLearn how to build a Laundry-to-Landscape system step-by-step\n\tMock-up a Laundry-to-Landscape &amp; Branched Drain system with real parts\n\nThis workshop will provide you with the basic knowledge and hands on instructions on how to install a Laundry-to-Landscape &amp; Branched Drain greywater system for your home. All attendees will receive informational hand-outs to complement the subjects covered in the workshop and free Dr. Bronner's biodegradable soap samples.\n\nINSTRUCTOR BIO\nTy Teissere specializes in backyard orchard care, from building the soil life to pruning the canopy, and the irrigation systems in between. He has taught ecological workshops on permaculture design, greywater, earthen construction, fermentation, and kids classes on making compost with worms. Ty is based in Pomona and is a certified arborist (#WE-10547-A), greywater installer (Greywater Action), rainwater harvester (Watershed Management Group), and has his horticulture certificate from Long Beach City College.\n\n\nCancellation Policy: We understand your plans may change.

        "description": "http://sigur-ros.co.uk/tour/2017/20170413-rvk-fest-1/\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic have announced that programming for their Reykjavík Festival will include three special shows by Sigur Rós performing some of their best loved works with the orchestra. This is the first time the band will have played publicly with an orchestra since shows for their unreleased work Odin’s Raven Magic in 2002-3. \n\nCo-curated by Icelandic composer Daníel Bjarnason and LA Phil Conductor Laureate Esa-Pekka Salonen, the Icelandic band will perform three nights at Walt Disney Concert Hall, playing career-spanning sets including fan-favorites (with orchestral accompaniment) and - “if things go to plan” - new, unreleased music (without orchestra).\n\nEach Sigur Rós performance (April 13, 14, 15) will be prefaced by a different symphonic and choral program. On April 13 festival co-curator Salonen will lead the LA Phil in the world premier of a new violin concerto from Daníel Bjarnason, performed by Pekka Kuusisto.  Bjarnarson first worked with Sigur Rós when he conducted the session on the band’s song “Ára Bátur” London’s Abbey Road for the Með suð í eyrum… album in 2008.\n\nThe April 13, 14, 15 programs will also include new work from long-term Sigur Rós collaborator and Amiina member Maria Huld Markan Sigfúsdóttir, as well as pieces from Anna Þorvaldsdóttir and Jón Leifs. In addition, the orchestra will also present the U.S. premieres of Haukur Tómasson’s piano concerto, with Icelandic soloist Vikingur Ólafsson, and Hlynur Aðils Vilmarsson’s BD. (see full schedule below)\n\nThe Reykjavík Festival is designed as an exploration of the eclectic Icelandic music scene, highlighting the creativity thriving in Reykjavík and covering a wide spectrum of music, from chamber, choral and symphonic to pop music.",

        "description": "The Broad is pleased to present the West Coast premiere of Tyler Hubby’s documentary film, Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present. The film examines the pioneering life and work of artist, musician, and educator, Tony Conrad, and this special iteration of The Un-Private Collection series highlights both his extraordinary career and his influence on the work of Broad collection artists including Mike Kelley, Robert Longo, and Tony Oursler. Since the early 1960s, Conrad's vast, inter-disciplinary repertoire has created and influenced major film and compositional movements. He performed in and recorded the soundtrack to Jack Smith’s legendary film Flaming Creatures; he defied conventions of cinema with The Flicker, an experimental structuralist film composed of a precise pattern of alternating black and white frames; he developed and practiced Just Intonation and Minimalism with Karlheinz Stockhausen and La Monte Young; and he was instrumental in the formation of The Velvet Underground. \n\nA post-screening conversation with Tyler Hubby and Tony Oursler will be moderated by Henry Rollins. Iconic artist and musician, Kim Gordon, who has collaborated with Tony Conrad, will perform to close out the night. Works by Tony Oursler in the Broad collection are currently on view in the collection installation, Creature, through March 19.\n\nBring your ticket for this program to The Broad and skip the line for general admission entry without advance reservation between March 14 - 19.",

For a small fee, all of the “poetry whores” are available for these sequestered readings at any time during the event. Of course, any true brothel needs a good cover; The Poetry Brothel’s is an immersive cabaret, offering a full bar, musicians, burlesque dancers, painters, actors, and fortune-tellers, with newly integrated themes, performances and installations at each event.\n\nDoors open at 8pm; show starts at 8:30pm.

Based in NYC, YOUNG has been featured on Gotham Comedy Live, The World Series of Comedy, Amateur Night at the Apollo and is a regular at clubs including The Stand in NYC, The Comedy Studio in Boston and Comedy Connection in Providence.\n\nJoe Messina is a comic based in Philadelphia.

Based in South Bend, Indiana, Patrick has performed in venues all over Michigan and Indiana.  He has performed at Gilda’s Laughfest, was a semifinalist in the Funniest Person in Grand Rapids, and a manager at The Drop Comedy Club in South Bend.\n\nBen Quick- With a thousand-watt smile and a razor-sharp intellect, Ben Quick has a lot on his mind.

        "description": "Sharktober Farallon Island Adventure\n\nIt's Sharktober!  Join Shark Conservationist and Naturalist David McGuire and other wildlife specialists celebrating sharks in a life-changing experience searching the Gulf of the Farallones for whales, wildlife and our finny friends.\n\nJoin us exiting beneath the Golden Gate for amazing photo and wildlife opportunities and crossing 28 miles across the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary on a modern day Natural History expedition.\n\nThese are Farallon Island -ecocentric expeditions. We focus on sharks and shark conservation, and the marine wildlife of the Gulf of the Farallones. We are a non-profit and not a commercial enterprise, and lead specialized trips during \"Sharktober.\"\n\n PLEASE NOTE: our trips are ecosystem, conservation and education wildlife trips and not explicitly shark watching trips. While we focus on shark biology and behavior while at the island and may possibly see a predation or dorsal fin, these are not the primary focus of our trips. If you want to join a shark viewing/cage diving trip please visit the NOAA Sanctuary site for conditions and recommended operators.\n\nDirections\n\nWe are confirming our vessel for the 2017 season, departing from San Francisco at the San Francisco Marina.\n\n Please join us on the Vessel by 0730 to begin boarding  for an 0800 departure. These trips are approximately 8 hours, but can run over if we are onto something good.\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nCalled the Devils Teeth by ancient mariners, these rugged, remote rocky islands host some of the most abundant and diverse marine life in the world.\n\nSeveral species of cetaceans are found near the Farallon Islands, most frequently gray whales, blue whales, and humpback whales.\n\nFive species of pinniped come to shore on the islands, and in some cases breed. These are the northern elephant seal, harbor seal, Steller's sea lion, California sea lion, and the northern fur seal (the last of which, like the Rhinoceros Auklet, began to return to the island again after protection).\n\nAs part of the Fish and Wildlife system, the Farallon Islands are an important reserve protecting a huge seabird colony. The islands' position in the highly productive California Current and Eastern Pacific upwelling region, as well as the absence of other large islands that would provide suitable nesting grounds, result in a seabird population of over 250,000. Twelve species of seabird and shorebird nest on the islands; Western Gull, Brandt's Cormorant, Pelagic Cormorant, Double-crested Cormorant, Pigeon Guillemot, Common Murre, Cassin's Auklet, Tufted Puffin, Black Oystercatcher,Rhinoceros Auklet, Ashy Storm-petrel, and Leach's Storm-petrel.\n\n\n\n* These exclusive trips explore and explain the natural history of the Great White Shark and other local species.  We will linger near the island searching for shark predation or other signs but we cannot attract sharks nor is this a shark trip. Although it is highly likely we will see many amazing species of wildlife, there is NO GUARANTEE of seeing sharks, whales or other specific wildlife. This is Nature- but lucky for us there is a lot of it out there and we have never been disappointed. This is not a Shark Viewing trip, but a shark conservation and wildlife appreciation experience. As wildlife viewing and timing allow we may visit the Continental Shelf to view pelagic species!\n\n\n\nDeparture\n\n Please join us on the Vessel by 0730 to begin boarding  for an 0800 departure.\n\nThe boat cannot wait for latecomers. We will go out in fog, light rain or small craft warnings (very unusual this time of year) at the captain's discretion but the boat needs to leave on time. We will return to the Bay about 4:00-4:30 p.m. Allow for delays, especially if unusual wildlife is encountered. Trips may be truncated or rescheduled if weather conditions deteriorate. See departure and refund details below.\n\nWeather &amp; Trip Rescheduling\n\nAlthough this is the best time of year to cross the Gulf, weather can be a problem outside of the San Francisco Bay. Light rain or fog generally do not result in cancellations. Decisions regarding cancellation may be made on the morning of the trip in unusual conditions, or the evening before based on the most current weather report. We will make our best estimate of weather conditions the evening before and if conditions warrant a cancellation may be made. Notification will be provided via Universe.\n\n Call into 415 350-3790 for a recorded message at 8:00 PM the evening before. We will make every attempt to inform you by email or this site beforehand but cannot personally contact the entire passenger list by telephone. \n\nFor passenger safety and comfort, once the vessel has left the Golden Gate routes up or down coast will be determined by the Captain. If conditions deteriorate this may be a coastal trip and the Gulf will be crossed at the Captain's discretion. There is still plenty of wildlife viewing at Drakes Bay or Pacifica in more sheltered waters. No refunds can be given once the boat has left the dock.\n\nRefunds &amp; Changes\n\nThe captain and operator will make the determination to depart, generally the evening before based on the current forecast. Trips may be canceled in advance due to undersubscription, hazardous weather conditions, Acts of God or emergency. If the trip is canceled for any of these reasons, we will honor your ticket on another trip.  If desired, you will receive a refund, less a $15 processing fee, within 30 days of cancellation.\n\nAn advance refund is allowed if received by email or through Universe  within 7 days of the departure date. You must have confirmation for the return to be valid minus a $15 processing fee for each canceled reservation.\n\nCancellation within 7 days of the scheduled departure time cannot be refunded. You will have the option to attend a trip at a later date at no penalty provided there is space. Due to scheduling we cannot accommodate repeat scheduling changes. We will honor your reservation for one year from date of first booking with 7 days advance notice.\n\nIn no event shall our liability exceed the obligation to refund more than the amount you paid to us. If you should miss your trip due to airline changes, cancellations, terrorist acts, acts of war, or related incidents, your fee will not be refundable. There are no exceptions to this policy.  Once the boat has left the dock, no refunds can be given.\n\nSafety and Access\n\nBoarding requires climbing up and down a six foot ladder.  The vessel cannot safely accommodate wheelchairs or persons on crutches  or persons with mobility problems due to conditions at sea.  Special accommodations may be made at the Captain/Owner's discretion but advance notice is required.  The vessel is equipped with all required US Coast Guard life safety equipment including communications, fire extinguishers, first aid and man overboard equipment. For your safety, persons with leg or other injuries, immobility or pregnancy are discouraged.\n\n* Note- this is a wildlife experience. Although it is highly likely we will see many amazing species of wildlife, there is no guarantee of seeing sharks, whales or other specific wildlife. This is Nature. This is not a Shark Viewing trip, but a shark conservation experience.\n\nContact the organizer for more details or questions.\n\nThis is a long day in the elements. Young children and babies are not allowed by the Captain. Youth over 10 accompanied by parents are encouraged! Please consult with us for making a reservation for anyone under the age of 10 years.\n\nSea SicknessThe Gulf of the Farallones can have rough waters. Seasick remedies are highly recommended, and they must be consumed prior to boarding to be effective. If you have not used these in the past please check with your doctor first, and read the directions on the label. A full night's rest the night before is important. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages the night prior to your trip and eat a healthy meal before boarding. Please avoid colognes and perfumes or other scents or food that may make you or other passengers queasy. Remedies like dried ginger have results for many. Other remedies include over-the-counter drugs, like Dramamine and Bonine, and prescription products like scopolamine patches. A new A new FDA-approved device, called the ReliefBand, sends a small electrical current through the same spot and has had positive reviews.\n\nWe do not endorse any specific remedies, but no alcohol and rest the night before, a good breakfast (low grease or fat,) hydration and healthy snacks are all recommended.  Here is a good survey article on motion seasickness.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\n\n\tBring layers of clothing. Sweaters and sweatshirts covered by a waterproof jacket or rain slicker work best. Long pants, hats and gloves are helpful. Wind on the water can cool the temperatures significantly.\n\tPlease no sandals or open toed shoes. Soft soled deck shoes, sneakers or sea boots are desirable.\n\tCameras and binoculars. Covers, towels or plastic bags can protect your equipment from spray.\n\tField guides.

With his unique background, Alan brings deep experience and applied skills to the challenge of integrating traditional Indo-Tibetan Buddhism with the modern world.\n\nSean Carroll is a theoretical physicist who has spent much of his career doing research on cosmology, field of theory, and gravitation– looking at dark matter and energy, modified gravity, topological defects, extra dimensions, and violations of fundamental symmetries. His focus has recently shifted more toward addressing fundamental questions in both quantum mechanics (origin of probability, emergence of space and time) and statistical mechanics (entropy and the arrow of time, dynamics of complexity). He is the author of many books, his most recent being The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself.\n\nPresented in Association with the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Engagement at Dartmouth",

The event combines artistry, sheer athleticism and cultural traditions to create an exciting, colorful and suspenseful competition.\n\nOn February 11 – 12, 2017, top American Indian and Canadian First Nation hoop dancers will compete at the Heard Museum to win the prestigious title and cash prizes at the two-day competition, in which men and women compete on an equal field.\n\nOver time, the intertribal hoop dance has expanded to incorporate new and creative designs and extremely intricate footwork. Each dancer presents a unique variation of the intertribal hoop dance, weaving in aspects of his or her distinct tradition and culture. Individual routines are presented using as few as four to as many as 50 hoops, which are manipulated to create a variety of designs including animals, butterflies and globes.\n\nDancers are judged on a slate of five skills: precision, timing/rhythm, showmanship, creativeness and speed. Contestants compete in one of five categories: Tiny Tots (5 and under), Youth (6-12), Teen (13-17), Adult (18-39), and Senior (40 and older).\n\nIn 2016, more than 80 contestants participated in the competition, in which Nakotah Larance (Hopi/Tewa/Assiniboine) successfully defended his 2015 title as adult world champion. Terry Goedel (Yakama/Tulalip) received another Senior Championship title, while Talon Ree Duncan (San Carlos Apache/Mandan/Hidatsa/Arikara) is now the new World Teen Champion. Jaron Yazzie (Navajo/Apache), 12, took top honors in the Youth Division.\n\nNOTE: Lawn seating only. Please bring folding chairs or blankets to sit on.

        "title": "Successfully Integrating Culture During A Merger or Acquisition",
        "description": "\n\t\n\tOverview: \n\t \n\t  During a significant change like a merger or acquisition, listening, \narchitecting and integrating both cultures is critical for maximizing \nthe value of the deal. Organizations that thrive in today's complex \nbusiness environment benefit from dynamic, robust cultures.\n\n\t\n\n\t It's common knowledge that mergers often fail or fall short of\n\nrealizing expected value due to complications during cultural\n\nintegration. When surveyed, many CEOs reported that they had no plan in\n\nplace for integration and even if they did, they wished in hindsight\n\nthat they'd had devoted more time and resources to cultural integration.\n\n\n\nWhy do we continue to perpetuate a problem we can solve? Bain Consulting\n\n reported that based on the survey data and anecdotal conversations with\n\n CEOs, executive leaders often don't know what to do when they need\n\naddress cultural integration. Cultural integration and cultural change\n\nare deemed \"fuzzy\" right brain areas that most action oriented, results\n\ndriven CEOs were challenged to address.\n\n\n\nYet successfully integrating the cultures of two different companies\n\nmatters because culture is a significant organizational driver, both\n\npositively and negatively. What's hardest to see, quantify or examine\n\noften holds the most power in an organization. Culture can encompass how\n\n companies communicate, how people and teams relate, how conflict is\n\nhandled, organizational beliefs, mindsets, emotions, and how events are\n\ninterpreted – all of which influence how problems are solved and\n\ndecisions are made.\n\n\n\nOn the quantitative side, 83% of mergers fail and 50% of leaders are\n\nterminated when these change initiatives fail to produce value. In fact,\n\n a 2011 global survey conducted by Aon Hewitt uncovered that\n\nunsuccessful cultural integration was the number two driver of deal\n\nfailure. The number one driver of deal failure was\n\n\"integration/implementation took longer than expected\" which in and of\n\nitself is adversely impacted by unsuccessful cultural integration.\n\n\n\nWithout successful integration, likely outcomes include:  mediocre, at\n\nbest, decisions, problems solved with band aide solutions, and the exit\n\nof good talent. And the bottom line value of the deal is adversely\n\nimpacted.\n\n\n\nWhen faced with a \"right brain\" issue, such as culture, companies often\n\ntry to create a linear \"left brain\" process to make addressing the\n\nissue.  Here's the problem with that: It doesn't typically work in\n\nimplementation or it doesn't work thoroughly enough over the long term.\n\n Ideally any problem would be solved using both our linear, analytical\n\nleft brain and our creative, intuitive right brain. Cultural integration\n\n is no different. Because culture is often rooted in the unspoken, the\n\nbelieved, the unintentional and the symbolic, it deserves plenty of\n\nright brain creative attention.\n\n\n\nDuring the webinar, we'll discuss a five step Cultural Integration\n\nDesign process that helps two different companies come together to form a\n\n culture that works together well. By executing this five step process,\n\nexecutive leaders retain and increase the value of their business during\n\n a merger or acquisition. The method includes these five steps: Cultural\n\n Intelligence Assessment, Cultural Profile, Cultural Architecture,\n\nDesign &amp; Prototype, and Integrate &amp; Train.\n\n\n\nWhy should you attend: According to a Deloitte\n\nsurvey, 43% of CFOs named post-deal integration a top concern.  A 2004\n\nMercer survey revealed that 75% of executives cited \"harmonizing culture\n\n and communicating with employees\" as the most important factors for\n\nsuccessful post-merger integration.\n\n\n\nA 2011 global survey conducted by Aon Hewitt discovered that\n\nunsuccessful cultural integration was the number two driver of deal\n\nfailure. The number one driver of deal failure was\n\n\"integration/implementation took longer than expected\" which in and of\n\nitself is adversely impacted by unsuccessful cultural integration.\n\n\n\nAreas Covered in the Session:\n\n\n\tUnderstand the definition of culture and its role in your organization's success or failure\n\tDiscuss key principles to assessing, influencing and designing culture\n\tReview a five step process for successfully integrating culture during a merger, acquisition or any significant change\n\nWho Will Benefit:\n\n\n\tC-Level Leaders\n\tSenior Leaders\n\tSenior Managers\n\tProject Team Leaders\n\n\n\tInstructor:\n\nClaudette Rowley As an executive coach,\n\n consultant and trusted advisor, Claudette has over 15 years of\n\nexperience working with clients both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nClaudette has a specialty in providing coaching to leaders and managers\n\nas well as training and facilitating teams in corporations on\n\ncommunicating for results and strategic organizational change.

Her mood storms have become intolerably severe; she has tried nearly every medication possible; her husband and children are suffering with her. So she opens the vial, places two drops on her tongue, and joins the ranks of an underground but increasingly vocal group of scientists and civilians successfully using therapeutic microdoses of LSD. As Waldman charts her experience over the course of a month–bursts of productivity, sleepless nights, a newfound sense of equanimity–she also explores the history and mythology of LSD, the cutting-edge research into the drug, and the byzantine policies that control it. Drawing on her experience as a federal public defender and the mother of teenagers, as well as her research into the therapeutic value of psychedelics, Waldman has produced a book that is as entertaining as it is eye-opening.\n\nAyelet Waldman is the author of the novels Love and Treasure, Red Hook Road, Love and Other Impossible Pursuits, and Daughter’s Keeper, as well as of the essay collection Bad Mother: A Chronicle of Maternal Crimes, Minor Calamities, and Occasional Moments of Grace and the Mommy-Track Mystery series. She was a Federal public defender and an adjunct professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law, where she developed and taught a course on the legal implications of the War on Drugs.\n\nDr. Jen Gunter is a Bay Area OB/GYN, veteran blogger and Twitter’s resident gynecologist. She hosts her own blog on reproductive health, DrJenGunter.com, and has written for Slate, The New Republic, Vox, The Daily Beast, TheHIll.com, and SELF.com.

On dark (moonless) nights on Tomales Bay, bluish white flickers are visible in the water column, which come from blooms of bioluminescent “dinoflagellates”. These tiny creatures emit short flashes of light when disturbed, and at certain times of the year put on quite a show for kayakers. Schools of fish in the bay create a phosphorescent trail which can look like a glowing cloud in the water. \n\nOn July 30th Salty Sound and Blue water Kayaking are collaborating on a  bioluminecence Kayaking trips. Blue Water Kayaking are running the kayaking trips with there expereince and veteran staff. Its a 24 hour camping trip located on a kayak only group camp site.  This means to get there its a short paddle across the bay. It is not the most challenging paddle, and most people are fully capable of accomplishing it. I do however require that you are comfortable in the water. Its a great time, and a hidden gem. Come  eat, come drink, come play. The cost of this trip is around $200 but worth every cent. There are very limited spaces. Please invite others who you think would be interested in such an event. For more information check out www.saltysound.com.",

Learn how to get - and stay - on a \nroll\n\n\t\n\n\t Getting in the zone requires that you take charge of your immediate\n\nenvironment to the degree that you can, as often as needed. You might\n\nfind that stress comes largely from the feeling of not being in control.\n\n There's something about taking control of your immediate environment\n\nthat enables you to get the best from yourself, to work with your\n\ninternal rhythms, and to produce superior results more easily and\n\neffortlessly.\n\n\tAs often as possible, you want to work with your internal rhythm so\n\nthat you get the best of yourself, while minimizing the wear and tear of\n\n working.  For example, any time you've been seated at your desk for\n\ntwenty minutes or so, it's best to get up and stretch, even if only for a\n\n few seconds. Your veins and your heart need this.\n\n\n\nIf you feel that your office and the surrounding technology is\n\ndeleterious to productivity and personal balance, let any disturbances\n\nhereafter serve as a reminder that while you can't control everything,\n\nthere are ways to turn situations to your advantage.  When you\n\ncreatively carve out sanctuaries for yourself, they give you both the\n\nquiet you need to get quality work done, and serve as a reminder that\n\nyou're in charge of your career.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you Attend: \n\n Being in the zone means that you get so much accomplished, or what\n\ntranspires flows so freely, that seemingly many more hours have past\n\nthan actually have. Would it be useful for you to know how to get into\n\nyour zone on a more consistent basis and achieve high productivity day\n\nafter day? You bet it would\n\n\tBeing in the zone occurs when you are not conscious of your output or\n\nresponsiveness in relationship to fixed time intervals, such as an hour.\n\n You can increase the likelihood of experiencing a favorable \"zone\"\n\neffect by removing yourself from the time measured environment - such as\n\n hiding the clock. This is why jotting notes while sitting on a park\n\nbench, in an airplane, or on your back porch, often yields greater\n\noutput than anticipated or accomplished during the same interval while\n\nat a desk in a traditional office. One hour of uncluttered thought can\n\nyield more benefits than days of common desk work.\n\n\n\nIf you want to get in the \"zone\" faster and easier and be your most\n\nproductive self, this program is definitely for you.

In 2013, he revealed that the NSA was seizing the private records of billions of individuals who had not been suspected of any wrongdoing, resulting in the most significant reforms to US surveillance policy since 1978. He has received awards for courage, integrity, and public service, and was named the top global thinker of 2013 by Foreign Policy magazine. Today, he works on methods of enforcing human rights through the application and development of new technologies. He joined the board of Freedom of the Press Foundation in February 2014.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg was a strategic analyst at the RAND Corporation, and consultant to the Defense Department and the White House, specializing in problems of the command and control of nuclear weapons, nuclear war plans, and crisis decision-making. Ellsberg joined the Defense Department in 1964 as Special Assistant to Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs) John McNaughton, working on the escalation of the war in Vietnam before transferring to the State Department in 1965 to serve two years at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. On return to the RAND Corporation in 1967, Ellsberg worked on the top secret McNamara study of U.S. Decision-making in Vietnam, 1945-68, which later came to be known as the Pentagon Papers. In 1969, he photocopied the 7,000 page study and gave it to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; in 1971 he gave it to the New York Times, the Washington Post and 17 other newspapers. His trial, on twelve felony counts posing a possible sentence of 115 years, was dismissed in 1973 on grounds of governmental misconduct against him, which led to the convictions of several White House aides and figured in the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon. He is the author of three books: Papers on the War (1971), Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers (2002), and Risk, Ambiguity and Decision (2001).\nA Benefit for Freedom of the Press Foundation",

Effortlessly combining soul, hip hop, and reggae, it showcased the confident vision of a young woman dealing with modern life - love, heartbreak, spirituality, racism - with the wisdom and aplomb of an old soul. 18 years later, the album still holds up as a modern classic, and it’s influence can be heard in the next generation of artists like Kehlani and Chance the Rapper.\n\nYBCA and UnderCover present a showcase of local Bay Area artists in a performance that pays homage to the Grammy award–winning artist Ms. Lauryn Hill. Over 75 diverse musical artists each lend their unique creative voices to a song from her iconic soul and hip hop album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Reinterpreting the classic record from start to finish, they create a musical cross-pollination that is unusual to encounter in a single bill. Clas/sick Hip Hop, now in its third iteration, is an artful platform that surfaces questions about the role of hip hop through music, movement, and the politics of freedom. This year YBCA explores gender norms in hip hop culture, highlighting the presence and impact of femininity in a subculture that has historically been undergirded by hyper-masculinity and violence. UnderCover Presents: A Tribute to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill reflects on gender in unique ways while also responding to ongoing curatorial inquiries into the viability of hip hop at a contemporary arts center. We ask ourselves how we can embrace its rapidly changing form as it takes new shape across the domestic landscape and is transposed within international bodies. Clas/sick Hip Hop is our vehicle.\n\n\"UnderCover productions have become storied, stylistically encompassing events that maximize the talent pool by limiting each act to a single song.\" - SF Chronicle\n\n\"...there are some performances you'll be talking about for the entire year.\"- SF Weekly\n\n\"...a vast, all-encompassing experience. We watched as the musical territory staked out got larger and larger, and the connection between making music and going to concerts got closer and closer.

She is beautiful, elegant and well-spoken and proves to be an enormous success particularly with the young gentleman Freddy Eynsford-Hill who falls desperately in love with her.\n\nAfter the ball Eliza falls into despondency as she sees Higgins celebrating his triumph in passing Eliza off as a duchess, showing little consideration for her feelings.

Most notable is the co-discovery of mirror symmetry, which launched a vibrant field of research in physics and mathematics, and topology change, which showed that the fabric of space can tear apart, counter to Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. Professor Greene is the co-founder and director of Columbia’s Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics, a research center seeking string theory’s implications for theories of cosmology. His many books include The Elegant Universe, The Fabric of the Cosmos, and his most recent, The Hidden Reality. With Emmy award winning journalist Tracy Day, Greene co-founded the The World Science Festival, a week-long celebration of science and discovery that has drawn over one and a half million people since its 2008 debut. \n\nAlexis Madrigal is the Editor-at-large of Fusion.net, a multi-platform media company delivering a mix of news and pop culture, as well as the author of Powering the Dream: The History and Promise of Green Technology. Formerly, he was a senior editor at The Atlantic and a staff writer at Wired. He is currently working on a podcast about the machinery of global capitalism and the Port of Oakland.

Jeff is a mainstay in the Bay Area comedy scene, and has performed at clubs across the country.\n\nJason Anderson is a comic from Sacramento, most well known for not getting his grandmother to stop bringing up that time he was on WeTV's Bridezillas.

She has performed on stages all over the state of Colorado as well as various parts of the country since 2014.\n\nReid Clark- \n\nReid Clark gave up his right testicle for comedy. Literally. He talks about it in his set, it’s funny yet uncomfortable like a lot of Reid’s humor. His comedy has been described as dark, blue, and political, with elements of musicality and improvisation. Reid has been doing comedy for 5 years but has been performing his whole life. He has opened for Alonzo Bodden, Neal Brennan, and Trevor Noah at Dead Crow Comedy Room in his home town of Wilmington, North Carolina. Reid also has improv, sketch and writing experience.

Combining a wide array of talents from the rhetorical to the musical, Ben's twisted, analytical neurosis brings a high-energy point of view to the stage that’s equal parts undeniable and uncompromising.\n",

The Poetry Brothel presents a rotating cast of both male and female poets as “whores,” each operating within a carefully crafted character, who impart their work in public readings, spontaneous eruptions of poetry, and most distinctly, as purveyors of private poetry readings on beds, chaise lounges and in private rooms. For a small fee, all of the “poetry whores” are available for these sequestered readings at any time during the event. Of course, any true brothel needs a good cover; The Poetry Brothel’s is an immersive cabaret, offering a full bar, musicians, burlesque dancers, painters, actors, and fortune-tellers, with newly integrated themes, performances and installations at each event.\n\nDoors open at 8pm; show starts at 8:30pm. Themed costumes and/or formalwear are encouraged but not required. This event is 21+.\n\nFor specific event details, please visit www.thepoetrybrothel.com/events.html.\n",

        "description": "3LAU with special guest Prince Fox &amp; Justin Caruso\n\n----\n\n3LAU approaches electronic dance music from an unexpected angle. The artist, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and entrepreneur born Justin Blau usually begins his compositions on the piano.\n\n“Everything typically starts on the piano,” he affirms. “I like to create the framework for a song traditionally and then add the electronics later.”\n\nIt’s a style he’s been cultivating since childhood. Commencing piano lessons at the age of three, he’ll tell you that he couldn’t go to sleep without classical music as a kid. His tastes would veer towards the likes of Radiohead and Sigur Ros in high school as he taught himself guitar, bass, and drums. During his sophomore year of college, he took a trip to Sweden and fell in love with electronic dance music. Upon returning home, 3LAU began creating.\n\n“I was so inspired by that trip,” he says. “I realized the possibilities within the genre, and I started making mashups bringing together well-known pop vocals and dance beats.”\n\nLeaving college in his junior year, he became a favorite on the club scene through relentless touring, initially turning heads with those innovative mashups. His 2013 original single “Escape” established his profile further. Generating 30 million-plus total streams, “How You Love Me” [feat. Bright Lights] dominated radio and closed out 2014 as SiriusXM BPM’s “Most Played Record of the Year.” Along the way, he’d garner support from the likes of Tiësto, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, Martin Garrix, and many more. However, he wanted to do more with music, so he launched Blume—the “first not-for-profit dance music label and philanthropic movement.”\n\n“Everybody treats music as a business,” he sighs. “I wanted to put the focus back on the music itself and do something good with it.”\n\nHis first single for Blume, “Is It Love” [feat. Yeah Boy], introduces the label, the movement, and a new sound. Coupling together a big room hook and entrancing production, the song racked up 2 million streams in less than a month. Meanwhile, the proceeds from its sales and streams supported the educational nonprofit Pencils of Promise (PoP)—which enables the construction of schools in developing countries. Pencils of Promise is just the first charity collaboration as 3LAU will diversify Blume’s impact in the charitable world with each subsequent release.\n\nBlume begins a bold, bright, and big new chapter for 3LAU and electronic dance music at large.\n",

Directed by Rob Reiner. Written by Nora Ephron. 1989. 1 hour, 36 minutes. Screened in English on BluRay.\n",

        "title": "Matt The Electrician Live at The Fire Room at Picks Gallery",
        "description": "\n\nAn evening with Matt the Electrician and friends. A listening room acoustic experience.\n\nDespite the name, Matt the Electrician is no longer an electrician, focusing instead on a music career that has spanned the course of two decades, a dozen records, and literally thousands of shows. It’s folk music for a modern age, rooted in lyrics that focus on the realities and challenges of the 21st century as opposed to, say, the old-school thrill of hopping trains.\n\n“I don’t generally write mining disaster songs,”he explains. “I tend to write about things that have happened to me and my family. Songs about the small things in life, which, to me, are really the big things.”\n\nWith his newest project, Matt gets by with a little help from his friends. Throughout 2015 and 2016, he’s focusing on a string of 7-inch vinyl singles. Every new release will focus on collaborations with different artists who’ve crossed Matt’s path over the years, including the bluegrass band Wood &amp; Wire (who appear on the very first installment of the vinyl series), experimental solo musician Little Brave, and others. Rather than record an entire album’s worth of material, then carefully plot the album’s release for months, Matt the Electrician will release the 7-inch records as they’re finished, with each new release following its predecessor by three or four months. The goal? To get new music to his fans as quickly and creatively as possible. The icing on the cake? Matt gets to extend the collaborative spirit that’s been present in his music ever since his very first gig in Pacific Grove, CA, when he invited his high school classmates to join him onstage.\n\n“The coffee shop paid me in tips, free coffee and a sandwich,” he remembers of that teenaged gig. “I had to fill three hours, and I only had two songs, so I invited all the friends I knew kids from the school orchestra, friends, other kids who had started writing songs and the show wound up being ‘Matt and Friends.’ That was 25 years ago and that’s what I’m still doing.”\n\nYears before moving to Texas and launching his career as a boundary-breaking, working-class folk musician, Matt Sever grew up on the West Coast. His parents, a union carpenter and a seamstress, played John Denver and Pete Seeger songs on the family record player, and Matt spent his earliest years surrounded by the things that would later fill his own music: acoustic guitars, timeless melodies, lyrics that celebrated the joys and heartaches of everyday life, and above all else a strong work ethic.\nThat work ethic served him well in the mid-1990s, when he moved to Austin in search of new horizons and better opportunities. Matt was already playing music by then, and in need of a steady day job to help pay the bills, he began working as an electrician, spending his days wiring houses in the sweltering Texas heat. Once quitting time came, he’d grab his guitar and drive himself to an evening show, usually taking the stage in his work boots and sweaty clothes. “Hi; I’m Matt the Electrician,” he’d tell the crowd, hoping his occupation would help explain his appearance. The name stuck, even after his growing fan base at home as well as abroad, where he’s since become a frequently-booked musician throughout Japan and Europe allowed him to hang up his pliers for good.Three time Grammy nominee, Peter Case’s work sets the bar for authenticity, passion and imagination and spans a number of genres, including folk, blues, and rock. Raised in Buffalo, NY, Case came to the Bay area in 1973 and worked as a street musician and played in the seminal power pop group The Nerves, before moving to Los Angeles to form the Plimsouls, landing a deal with Geffen Records.\nThe Plimsouls achieved success with the hit single, “A Million Miles Away,” which landed them a role in the movie Valley Girl, as the band performing during the club scenes. Case’s 1986 solo Geffen Record debut revealed deep roots in folk and blues, and earned him his first Grammy nomination for the song “Old Blue Car” as well as the Number 1 spot on the NY Time’s 1986 Best CDs list. Six CDs later, Case earned another nomination for Let Us Now Praise Sleepy John, a remarkable collection of songs that features Case’s voice and a single guitar. It’s clear that Case is a major talent on the Americana troubadour landscape.\n\nThis will be a snacks show. Bring snacks to share and your favorite beverages. The gathering starts at 6:30, the music by 8.\n",

        "description": "Royal Stompbox presents:Funky Bollywood Classic DISCO DANCER\n\nMonday, February 13th\n\n7:00pm – Funky Bollywood Pre-Show8:00pm – Disco Dancer\n\n“I have my music. I will sharpen it like a sword. And stab the city’s heart with it!”\n\nDISCO DANCER is pure gonzo movie bliss and one of the best musical rags-to-riches movies ever made. A huge hit upon its release in 1982, not just in India, but also the USSR, China, Turkey – parts of the globe that caught the disco fever a little later than the USA – DISCO DANCER is an exhilarating crown jewel of greasy, funky, gaudy, glorious, early 80s Bollywood at its pleasure pinnacle.\n\nA poor street musician kid named Anil is happy performing with his mentor Raja (Rajesh Khanna), until one day a girl, Rita, is enticed by Anil’s music and joins him for a song and dance, which  sends Rita’s evil music industry tycoon father into a rage. Anil is badly beaten and his mother is framed for theft and imprisoned. Anil, in true filial Bollywood fashion, dedicates his life to clear his mom’s besmirched name and become a superstar in the process. Now all grown up, virtuous big-hearted disco dance heartthrob Anil aka ‘Jimmy’ is a star on the rise (Mithun Chakraborty, catapulted to superstardom in real life), pitted against corrupt, heroin-junkie son of a bitch cocky disco king (Karan Razdan), falling in love with grown-up and conflicted Rita (Kim), culminating in a battle at the International Disco Dancing Competition!\n\nBappi Lahiri’s soundtrack is just awesome and endlessly groovable, inspiring many musicians – including Devo’s “Disco Dancer”, and most notably “Jimmy Jimmy Aaja Aaja” was lifted by M.I.A. for “Jimmy” from her breakout album Kala (2007). Lahiri himself \"borrows\" melodies from The Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star” and “Do-Re-Mi” from The Sound of Music (!). Disco Dancer had a 1987 Hindi sequel, DANCE DANCE, and was remade in Tamil as PADDUM VAANAMPAADI (1985) and Telegu as DISCO KING (1984). The climactic song “Yaad Aa Raha Hai” is a show-stopper, a sublime electronic dance-pop classic to rival Giorgio Moroder &amp; Donna Summer.\n\nFeaturing sinister drug-addled disco villains, a death by guitar electrocution, a big bald white baddie (Bob Christo), a guitar being karate-chopped in two, and more disco lights and slamming dance numbers than you’ve ever dared to dream, DISCO DANCER is the emblem of disco heaven.\n\nCome early for the pre-show – a delirious, wonderful, pleasure overload of 70s/80s funky Bollywood excess!\n\nLanguage/Subtitles: Hindi with English subtitles\n",

It refers to our inner orientation, the core of our being.This kind of “Heart” is what the ancients referred to when they told us to store up treasures in heaven instead of on earth, “for where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.”  When we say to someone “my heart goes out to you,” we mean something more than a feeling of concern. If said sincerely, it communicates a sense of solidarity with someone. It means more than “I understand” (our intellect). It means more than “I sympathize” (our feelings). It means something like, “I stand with you in this.” It is an expression of a fundamental choice.On this night, February 11th 2017 just as it has been done for 10 years:The PEX Community will stand together, in unity, in solidarity and in Love.We invite You to join us and in doing so You will make a fundamental choice.

In this workshop, you'll learn all about ingredients and beauty product recipes, with hands-on experimentation to find the right combinations for your skin type. We'll be covering oils, waxes, essential oils, herbs, spices and other helpful ingredients. We'll be making 3 products in this interactive workshop: body butter, bath bombs and lip balm! You’ll get to take home the products you’ve made (just in time for Valentine’s Day), plus the recipes and knowledge to recreate those products at home. Delicious food and drinks will be available through Settlement Co.\n\nThe Eco Well is a resource for evidence based health and wellness education, based in Waterloo. Through ongoing community outreach and DIY lessons, their mission is to help create a healthier, more informed and more empowered community. The Eco Well is also a manufacturer of eco-friendly vegan health and beauty products. The Eco Well was founded by Jen Novakovich, a Waterloo based health and nutrition educator.\n\nThe cost is $30 for the workshop. Proceeds from the event will go towards supporting The KW Vegan Society.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND! “But overall, for me, it’s the best version of the movie. It’d be interesting to see if you agree.” -George Miller \n\nThe latest sequel to the MAD MAX franchise \"Fury Road\" captivated audiences in 2015 when it hit the big screens, taking the soul of the original trilogy and then upping the ante to a clinically insane degree. We got more car chases with bigger, supped up vehicles, a barren Australian hellscape, and most importantly, the scariest bad-guy yet in the series, Immortan Joe - a petrifying tyrannical ruler hell-bent on total control. \"Fury Road\" follows our post-apolcalyptic cowboy Max Rockatansky, after he stumbles into another situation and eventually agrees to help his new friends. Max meets the rebel Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and a group of escaped female prisoners who are on their way to safety out of Joe's reach, but first to get there they must endure one of the most pulse-pounding chases in cinematic history. Originally done in an acidic palette of oranges and teals, perhaps more suited to something directed by big-budget mavens like Michael Bay, this edition burns it down to a slick monochrome to give audiences a completely different experience. Director George Miller adores the release, saying, “Something about black and white, the way it distills it, makes it a little bit more abstract. Something about losing some of the information of colour make it somehow more iconic.\"\n",

Doors open at 9 PM. $8 advance. $10 at the door.\n\nThe My Tys\n\nSydney's favorite ska outfit THE MY TYS have brought their take on 2 Tone ska and funky reggae to Chicago! With a nod towards the classic 2 Tone bands such as Madness, the Specials and Bad Manners THE MY TYS have managed to carve out their own sound bringing something new to the Chicago Ska and Reggae scene!\n\nSoft Speaker\n\nThe original Sanftsprecher\n\nUnder duress from the USM (Unified Society of Milkmen), Joseph Daley, Blair Douglass, Paul Foreman and Nicholas Rocchio shut down their independent milk delivery service in 1929.  A smattering of unsuccessful endeavors followed, until they discovered an undeniable chemistry blending finger-picked guitars with lutes and clarinets.  Although initially less lucrative than the milk business, the quartet, who settled on the name Sanftsprecher (trans. “Soft Speaker”), were championed by Austria’s Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1932 and subsequently enjoyed a period of massive popularity in their newly-adopted home country.  The band split following Dollfuss’s assassination in 1934. Their only official recording, the 78rpm single, I’ll Tend Your Garden, is highly sought after by record collectors.  In 2008, enthusiasts of the band purchased sheet music for a number of unrecorded Sanftsprecher songs that were discovered in Rocchio’s safe deposit box in UniCredit Bankengruppe.  Austria’s Tonkünstler-Orchester Niederösterreich has been recording interpretations of these songs and releasing them for the public’s listening pleasure.  Separately, a ramshackle group of Chicago-based musicians has taken it upon themselves to perform and record these songs in a strikingly rudimentary manner with crude electric instruments, much to the dismay of purist fans that prefer the orchestral versions.\n\nJacob Horn Trio\n\n\n\nA ill-named narcissistic band from Chicago.\n",

        "title": "Shawna Caspi",
        "description": "“The power of one person and one instrument – engaging and exciting in itself. I believe that’s the root of folk music”. \nWith her third album, Apartments For Lovers, Shawna Caspi taps right into those folk roots, stripping away the session musicians and elaborate arrangements of her previous records in favour of a simple, authentic sound – her solo guitar and voice. The result is a collection of songs that is close-up and honest, showcasing her warm vocals, classically-trained fingerstyle guitar playing, and intimate songwriting in a genuine, powerful way.\n\nOn Apartments For Lovers, Shawna creates delicate, quiet moments that are vulnerable and accessible even when she’s writing about someone else. Her songs are snapshots – moments that may appear small, but which subtly carry weight and offer greater depth thanks to her well-crafted lyrics.\n\n“Some musicians make songwriting sound less of a craft and more of a life affirming obsession. Caspi’s compositions stand out as beautiful, complex and intricate…” – NOW Magazine, NXNE preview\n\nFor 15 years, Shawna has been playing the guitar she bought at the Ottawa Folklore Centre, one of Canada’s best loved music stores. This cherished instrument has accompanied her on tour throughout Canada and the United States, where she has played festivals including the Blue Skies Music Festival, the Summerfolk Festival, the Deep Roots Music Festival, and the Ottawa Grassroots Festival. It was also her constant companion as she played on the long haul trains between Montreal and Halifax and between Vancouver and Toronto as part of the VIA Rail On Board Entertainment Program.\n\nWhile she never had one particular musical influence growing up, Shawna found inspiration in a wide variety of independent singer/songwriters as she played and sang her way through the folk music scene. Some of these artists are now her peers, and she has shared the stage with several of her favourites, including Rose Cousins, Jon Brooks, James Keelaghan, Old Man Luedecke, Suzie Vinnick, and Garnet Rogers.\n\n“Shawna Caspi has the rare gift of presence that immediately invites audience engagement, from the first strum of her skilled guitar playing to the last exquisite note she sings”. – Andy Frank, co-founder of Roots Music Canada\n\nFrom cafes, soft-seat theatres, living rooms, festival stages, and yes, even trains, Shawna is making her living singing her stories on tour. She loves the landscapes of her travels and while weaving them into her songs, she has also been portraying them on canvases. Shawna paints one-of-a-kind works of art inspired by the rich scenery she sees and makes them available for sale with her merchandise. Two of those paintings make up the front and back cover artwork for Apartments For Lovers.\n\nShawna’s Canadian folk roots are an intrinsic part of who she is. In fact, Shawna as a solo musician is exactly who she is as a person – warm, inviting, a storyteller, a traveler, an authentic artist. “And at the heart of everything”, she says, “I’m just a really big music fan”.\n",

Some of Canada’s brightest emerging artists will perform highlights and hand-picked vignettes of Tapestry's repertoire alongside operatic masters, such as Krisztina Szabó, Keith Klassen, and Steven Philcox.  The performance will be preceded by a reception and a talk at 6pm (venue TBD) by Tapestry Opera’s Artistic Director, Michael Mori, where he will examine the creative process and contemporary classical opera pedagogy.\n\nTapestry's Songbook is a collection of absurd, tragic, and beautiful works exploring contemporary life through music.  We will discuss the history and development of some of the key works of the evening, and detail the journey that emerging artists take on their career to become professionals.  What is the skill set of the successful professional in Canada?  How much more does one need than simply having a beautiful voice? What signs can the untrained eye and ear look for in a young emerging artist so as to guess the future of their career?\n\nWe hope you can join us for an unforgettable evening with Tapestry Opera, along with the creative team as well as fellow art and culture enthusiasts.\n\nTSC Team\n\nThe Social Collective is brought to you by Bazaar Marketing &amp; Communications Inc.\n",

Author of From Conflict to Creative Collaboration: A User's guide to Dynamic Facilitation, Rosa has been practicing this work since 2000 and leads workshops internationally. \n\nDynamic Facilitation is a \npowerful way to support  groups that are working on challenging issues \nacross highly diverse perspectives. Originally designed by consultant \nJim Rough,  It's a particularly useful way for working across silos and \nwith multi-stakeholder groups -- wherever we want to tap the creative \npotential of differences.\n\t More info on it below. \n\nThis is a rare opportunity to learn this powerful approach, from a gifted practitioner and teacher. \n\nHeart-Centered Listening describes Rosa's continually evolving practice, which \nalso incorporates elements of Focusing &amp; experiential listening, transformative \neducation, action research, Systemic Constellations work, and more.  \n\tYou can learn more about Rosa and her work at www.Diapraxis.com\n\n\nOur hosting team includes:\n\nLeah Boyd is a \nmediator, facilitator, and communications skills trainer. The founder of\n Peaceful Purpose Mediation Services,  she is a certified Nonviolent \nCommunication trainer, mediates in a variety of settings including \nfamily matters within the district court system and has sat on\n the Board of Governors of the Maine Association of Mediators. \n\t\n\nKaren Groat is the \ndirector of the Opportunity Alliance Mediation Service.

He is also a medical doctor, and practices Emergency Medicine in the Berkshires. \n\n\nMore on Dynamic Facilitation: In\n Europe, a combination of Dynamic Facilitation followed by World Café is being  \nused to host Civic Councils, a highly effective participatory public policy process.  Here is a \n\t\n\t 5 minute overview video  of a recent Civic Council held in Vorarlberg, Austria in response to the current refugee crisis.\n\nDynamic Facilitation can also be used productively  in a business context. In this  6-minute video you can see the  combination of Dynamic Facilitation followed by World Café to support organizational learning within a Swiss telecommunications company.\n\nNew to Dynamic Facilitation?\n\t\tWelcome!

If you want to learn more about this methodology, you can find more info here; you can also read more about the workshops here.\n\n\nWorkshop Logistics\n\nCEU's for mediators will be provided.\n\nFinancial Accessibility: Our intention is to make this work  available to a wide spectrum of folks  by keeping our fees low and by offering two fee options.

Scott, The NY Times\n\n“Different from any other movies you'll see in this or any other year.” - Molly Laich, Vanguard Seattle\n\nPresented on 35mm!The Love Witch is a breath of fresh air and a fruit ripe with symbolism for discussing gender politics! The film stars Samantha Robinson as Elaine, a witch who moves to a new town and begins to use spells to enrapture men in her path. She fantasizes about finding a perfect love, but as the body count begins to rise from the aftermath of her supernatural handiwork, she finds her haunted libido is surrounded by a town full of people ready for battle. Meticulously crafted on 35mm film by genre revisionist Anna Biller, this is a bubbling potent potion made of equal parts melodrama, pulp and exploitation with a heavy dose of ‘70s Technicolor. This loving homage stands apart as a contemporary genre must-see that challenges gender expectations. Smart and unmissable!\n",

Ask about our discount pricing for U.S. military veterans.\n\nLIKE us on Facebook: www.Facebook.com/NYSafetyandTraining\n\nVisit our website: www.NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings mandates that all workers at major construction sites must have had the OSHA 10-hour Construction Industry safety class within the last five years. DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\n\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\n\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n",

        "description": "\n\n\n\nCelebrating the Women of Craft Beer, Celebrating the Craft Beer of Women\n\nThe Tri-Cities Cask Festival Association is proud to announce The Siris Cask Festival, a Craft Cask event featuring 30+ beers brewed exclusively by women.\n\nThe goal of the festival is to provide a venue to showcase the amazing skill of our female brewers, reaching back to a time when the important duty of brewing beer was exclusively the role of women in society. Siris was the original goddess of beer in pre-Sumerian mythology.\n\nThe other goal for the festival is to provide a bursary for Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s Brewing Studies program. The bursary will be available to female students, with the intention of helping achieve gender parity in the brewing industry.\n\nIn keeping with spirit of the festival, the first hour will be open only to women. After that hour, the ticketed public will be allowed in.\n\nSome quick answers to your questions: \n\nWhen, Where, How: April 22nd 2017, at the Cat and Fiddle Pub, 11 am to 5 pm (1st hour open only to women).\n\n Participating Breweries are:\n\n\n\t\n\tMoody Ales Featured Brewer Roxanne Cartwright\n\t\n\tYellow Dog Brewing\n\tKPU Brewing &amp; Brewery Operations Program Female Students\n\tMore to be announced as they officially register, check back regularly\n\nWho are the brewers?\n\n There are only three craft breweries in BC that have women designated as head brewers, but there are dozens of women working at every craft brewery. We approached almost all of BC’s craft brewers to have their female staff produce casks for Siris. The response was immediate and enthusiastic.\n\nBreweries that didn’t have a woman as an active member of their fermentation staff almost all had women working for them with brewing skills—either attending brewing school or as home brewers, or from working with other breweries in the past—who stepped in and brewed, again with enthusiasm.\n\nFor breweries without the benefit of female brewers in-house, we were able to connect them with female brewers from inside the industry: cicerones, inside staff, account managers, and others who had the skill and love of brewing. In the end, it all came together.\n\nFor an updated list of all the breweries and a short bio of each brewer, please click on this link SIRIS BREWERS BIO'S\n\nSpecial Event Sponsors:\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat do I get with my ticket?\n\nEach ticket includes access to the event, 10oz Tasting Glass, 10 tokens for 4oz tasting (you can use 2 tokens to have the glass filled), Event Program, Entry in to the Door Prize Draws. If you choose the T-Shirt option it will include one Siris Cask Festival T-Shirt in the size you indicate.   Additional tokens will be available at the venue for $2 each.\n\n \n\nWhat do I need to get in?\n\nYou will need to present your ticket in either paper form or on your digital device. 2 pieces of valid ID\n\nFemales only for the first hour?\n\nIn celebrating the women of craft brewing we want to also recognize the female consumers of craft beer with giving them the first hour 11am-Noon with out the male consumers. Event will open to everyone at Noon.\n\nAre you women? Who’s running the show?\n\nNo, we’re a non-profit society that organizes the largest and best-attended cask festivals in BC. We’ve done the behind-the-scenes organizing to get the space and the casks together, but it’s not our show—we are just holding the curtain for the important players, the brewers.\n\nSo are you speaking for the women of brewing?\n\n No. The Women of Craft Brewing don’t need anybody to speak for them. All they need is a place to speak for themselves. As such the TCCFA has only two mandates: to facilitate a great cask festival, and to use ticket proceeds to endow a bursary available to female students at KPU. The rest of the festival is up to the brewers themselves. We’re as excited as anyone to see where they take it. That’s part of the reason why it’s women-only in the first hour: networking, celebrating, sharing and enjoying great beer.\n\n How much is the bursary? How will it be awarded?\n\t\n\n Our pledge to KPU is set at $1500 for this festival. We’re planning on driving that number higher—as high as we can—through merchandise sales and donations. The award criteria is handled by the finance department at KPU, but the award will go to a female student entering their second year who demonstrates financial need and meets the minimum GPA.\n\n Is that a depiction of Siris in your logo? Isn’t Ninkasi the goddess of brewers?\n\t\n\n It’s actually a stylized image of Innana, the mother-goddess that originated in Uruk. There are no definitively identifiable images of Siris, or indeed of Ninkasi. Siris actually preceded Ninkasi as the goddess of beer and brewing among the Semite peoples and later got folded into Sumerian mythology as a daemon daughter of Ninkasi. We chose Siris because she was earliest, and because there’s a famous brewery named after Ninkasi that we didn’t want to be confused with. Ancient anthropology is fun, but not simple.\nIs the registration/ticket transferable?\nYes. Tickets can be gifted. As long as the ticket can be presented either in paper or digitally everything is fine.\nCan I get Tickets at the door?\nIf the event is not sold out tickets will be available at the door for $45.\n\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\n\nThis\n is a 19 + event. No admittance under the age of 19. We will be \nrequiring 2 pieces of valid ID to enter the venue. If you do not have ID\n you will be turned away and no refund will be provided.\nWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?\nThere\n will be plenty of parking on site and surrounding area. Taxi service is \navailable, public transit is just step from the venue and there are \nseveral services that can drive you and your vehicle home.\n\nWhat is the refund policy?\n\nThe\n registration deadline is January 22nd, 2017. Full refunds are \navailable prior to January 14th, 2017. There will be no ticket sales \nand no refunds at the event. After this date no refunds will be offered.\n To request a cancellation or to make a change please send an email to \ninfo@tricitiescaskfestival.com\n\nIf you have any other questions, please send us a note to info@sirisfestival.com and put ‘Siris’ in the subject line. We’ll get back to you with an answer.\n\nAre you with media and would like to contact us? Please email media@sirisfestival.com\n",

        "description": "LADIES of BURLESQUE pays tribute to the legendary Leonard Cohen with McCABE &amp; MRS. MILLER—Robert Altman’s iconic, critically acclaimed anti-Western. Featuring the most beautiful and haunting music Cohen ever composed, McCABE &amp; MRS. MILLER revels in the “Maestro of Melancholy’s” ability to capture the essence of doomed romance and the elusive, bewitching women that only Cohen could conjure. With Sam Antics on stage performing a seductive Cohen-dedicated burlesque, this is a LADIES of BURLESQUE that plays it close to the heart.\n\nWarren Beatty is John McCabe, a gambler who establishes a low-rent brothel in a rough-and-tumble Old West mining town. Ill-equipped to deal with the particulars of this new business and unable to inspire the prostitutes (one of which is played by Shelley Duvall) to greater professional heights, McCabe is easily swayed into partnering with the newly-arrived Constance Miller (Julie Christie)—an experienced Madam and keen business woman. Together, they turn the brothel around and business flourishes. When mining company agents threaten McCabe and Mrs. Miller after they refuse to sell their land, McCabe is forced to fight for his community of gamblers and prostitutes, precipitating a shoot out sequence that defies all Westerns that came before.\n\nAltman found divine inspiration in Cohen’s debut album, “Songs of Leonard Cohen” when writing the film and the director fought hard to secure rights to it. Cohen’s lyrics—with visuals of deathly winter, cold-hearted women, and men desperate for comfort—define the film’s iconography and mood, leading to one of the most significant uses of music in film, and a masterpiece (both musical and visual) like no other.\n",

We believe that we can engage with art in many forms. At the end of the art tour, violinist Ivana Popovic, will play three short solo violin pieces.

Pieces will be selected from the classical, modern repertoire or composed for the purpose of the exhibit.\n\nDuring this tour, Elsha Leventis, will talk about her art, her inspiration and her journey as an artist and mother.  The talk will be followed by a short solo violin performance.\n\nNote:  given the smaller size of the studio, it will be a very intimate tour.\n\nThe tour will take place in Elsha Leventis' studio located in the Case Goods Artscape Building on the ground floor.  The Artscape building is the big brown 6 floor building behind Balzac's cafe on Case Good's lane - http://www.livingatthedistillery.com/the-neighbour...\n\nThe fee for the event is $10.

        "description": "DescriptionProducing an aesthetically pleasing event that truly impresses seen-it-all attendees can be a daunting task. Adding to the pressure, today’s event designers are expected to incorporate food and beverage, technology, and branding and find innovative ways to play with color, create unique focal points, use lighting to make a space feel more intimate, and select florals that don’t max out the budget. Do you have the creative edge? Or, at a minimum, can you intelligently “talk the talk” with creative vendors in order to convey your vision?This course you will cover the key principles of modern event design including how to create a design concept that achieves the client's goals, meets their budget, and can be executed in the venue with the time allotted. Implement a wide range of elements into your next design concept, such as floral, furniture, lighting, branded accents, entertainment, technology and others. Identify opportunities for creating custom fabrication pieces that can be unique focal points for guests, which helps to set yourself apart from others.  By the end of the course you will be able to evaluate a venue's challenges and assets that will be incorporated into a design concept, and how to insure you can execute your vision within the time and space available.\n",

Since this devastating news, Hannah has gone through 8 rounds of excruciating chemotherapy scheduled to be as long as fifty hours per round. Prior to her diagnosis, Hannah was an ice-skater, cheerleader and volleyball player. On August 23rd  2016, Hannah underwent complete reconstructive surgery to install a new prosthetic knee. After this procedure, the tumor was removed, and her prognosis has improved tremendously. However, Hannah needs to undergo 10 more rounds of chemotherapy, which will keep her from going back to school for her eighth grade year. Instead,... she will be tutored at home and in the hospital, where she will miss out on all of her eighth grade activities. Not only will Hannah be unable to attend school, she will also be unable to participate in her extracurricular activities. Needless to say, this unfortunate situation has created a medical and financial burden for Tom &amp; Lori Jarosik-Carroll-our brother, sister, son, daughter and friends. For this reason, we have organized a benefit to be held Sunday, February 26th 2017 to honor and support Hannah and help raise funds for her continuing medical needs. We will have tons of entertainment including live bands and irish dancing as well as raffles and silent auctions.\n\nIf you cannot make the fundraiser and would still like to donate, please click on the link below or email us at hannahstrong2017@gmail.com.

Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards.\n\nOSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint.

This topic is most common to industrial or MAKING work places which have such as a printing press or assembly line.\n\nIntroduction to Industrial HygieneIndustrial hygiene is the science of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling workplace conditions that may cause workers' injury or illness. Specifically, this topic covers considerations of ventilation and circulation of potentially hazardous fumes or vapors in the work place.\n\nBloodborne PathogensCovers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic microorganisms in the blood that could carry hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among other pathogens.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramCovers topics for consideration for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs\n\nFall ProtectionCovers ways to protect workers against fall hazards.

We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n",

Nonviolent Communication partners practical skills with a powerful consciousness and vocabulary to help you get what you want peacefully.\n\nIn this internationally acclaimed text, Marshall Rosenberg offers insightful stories, anecdotes, practical exercises and role-plays that will dramatically change your approach to communication for the better.

Celebrating the best and campiest of black cinema and its heroes from then ‘til now, Black Gold’s inaugural film is BLACK BELT JONES and is co-presented by KUNG-FU FRIDAYS.\n\nDirected by Robert Clouse and starring Jim Kelly, both fresh off of Enter the Dragon, 1974’s Black Belt Jones gives its black heroes center stage. Kelly stars at the titular Jones and is tasked with saving local legend Pop Byrd’s karate school from the predatory business interests of the city’s quickly encroaching mafia and drug-dealing associates. Joined by Byrd’s students and daughter (played by a show-stealing, ball-busting Gloria Hendry), Jones kicks ass and is not here for any white nonsense.\n\nA perfect blend of martial arts and blaxploitation, the film offers Jones and Hendry as the archetypal, community-minded heroes we’ve come to know from the surge of blaxploitation cinema which followed. While critically maligned at the time in the shadow of Enter the Dragon’s success, Black Belt Jones clearly stands on its own - it's all-black and all-kitsch, baby. Come for Jim Kelly, stay for the indeterminately extended car wash fight scene.\n\nGenerously sponsored by Loveless Cafe &amp; Bar.\n",

        "title": "Music 4.5 – The Economics of Streaming",
        "description": "The Economics of Streaming…and the ‘value gap’\nConsumption of streaming music, media and entertainment is exploding around the world. Free, ad-supported music services are reaching millions of users who want to listen to what they want, when they want. Since the creation of the first paid subscription services 15 years ago, the labels have considered on-demand access to be consumption - not promotion - eventually competing with and replacing the lucrative sales model their businesses were built on.\n\nToday the largest music service in the world is YouTube, with 1billion monthly active users. Over 58% of Internet users in the U.S. have a YouTube account. Facebook has 1.71bn monthly active users (with more than 1bn daily active users on mobile); Twitter has 320mm, and Spotify has 100mm. Contrast these user numbers withthe paying subscriber numbers of Apple Music, now at over 20 million subscribers, and Spotify with 40 million paying subscribers.\n\nYouTube stars are garnering vast audiences and enviable revenue, while music artists and the music industry are increasingly frustrated that they are not receiving comparable value for the use of their music and compositions. They argue that YouTube isn’t a revenue generator commensurate with its user base. New consumption patterns and a specific video and YouTube culture have emerged, which in conjunction with the existing Safe Harbor legislation, is changing the relationship between fan, star and revenue-generation\n\nSiding with the record industry over the amount of money YouTube pays to artists and labels Andrus Ansip, VP for the Digital Single Market at the European Commission, estimates that YouTube now contributes $679m a year to music rights-holders, despite its billion-plus monthly audience, while Spotify alone delivers $1.8bn.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last twelve months, YouTube has paid out over $1 billion to the music industry from advertising alone. Unlike the audio streaming services, YouTube won’t commit to pay minimum guarantees based on users and usage, but it will share ad income with music rights owners, meaning that income to the music industry goes up as more ads are sold, not more videos streamed.\n\nWhat are the economics of streaming – for the service providers, the rightsholders, the artists and the users?\n\nIf ad-supported and subscription services are increasingly competing head-on, should free services be paying the same percentage of their income to rights holders as paid subscription services? What is the impact of the DMCA Safe Harbor provision on revenue for rights holders?\n\nWhat changes in legislation, licensing and contracts will guarantee a marketplace where the two different business models - free, ad-supported and paid-for subscription - can be made to work “fairly” with increased revenues returned to artists and rightsholders?\n\nMusic 4.5 The Economics of Streaming will examine the economics and business models of streaming, the latest developments around music licensing, the implications of digital service providers different business models, legislative reform, as well as the impact of the ad-market dynamics on per-stream rates for artists, record labels, publishers, and collective rights management organizations.\n\nWe will cover questions such as:\n\n\n\tHow can the ‘free model’ be made to work better and more fairly for artists? \n\tWill the review of safe harbor legislation deliver a level playing field between ad-supported and subscription-based service providers, e.g. Spotify and YouTube? \n\tWill ‘take down’ also mean ‘stay down’? What are the issues with ‘stay down?’ How accurate is YouTube’s Content ID?\n\tHow to grow the pie by opening up for additional royalties collection? What are the additional but currently neglected and untapped revenue streams, e.g. performance royalties for terrestrial radio? \n\tEveryone mentions YouTube, but how about the other big platform and social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, which are increasingly focused on video content delivery? Will they also rely on the DMCA Safe Harbor for user-uploaded content, or will they negotiate agreements with labels and publishers? What is the potential impact for artists and the music business? \n\tHow do artists, rightsholders, and users navigate multi-territory licensing? \n\tIs it the government’s role to legislate rates to guarantee a competitive marketplace? \n\nIf consumption is free, what is the value of promotion?\n",

        "description": "\n\n\n\nThe foundation of the I Am Initiative is based on Think —&gt; Feel —&gt; Act. The guiding message is self-protection through self-love.\n\nGirl Scout Events are 2-hour workshops designed to dynamically teach the 3 rules of self-protection. The girls learn cool kickboxing moves as well as practical tools to live confidently and powerfully in the world. All workshops include earning a fun self-protection badge.\n\n\nTHINK: I AM STRONG (My thoughts guide my attitude)\nWhat you think is who you are. The first rule of self-protection is: F.L.Y.(FIRST LOVE YOURSELF). Strong self-esteem allows you to take care of yourself and be kind to others because you know who you are and how to express yourself confidently.\n\n\nFEEL: I AM CONFIDENT (My attitude guides my actions)\nThe I Am Initiative teaches girls to stay out of proximity of any situation where they are endangered, while challenging them to face their fears. When you trust yourself you are confident and are able to stand up for what you feel is right. In uncomfortable scenarios you will be able to trust your gut and follow the second rule of self-defense: FACE YOUR FEARS. RUN AWAY FROM DANGER.\n\n\nACT: I AM POWERFUL (My actions create my reality)\nWhat you do is intricately connected to what you think and how you feel. The third rule of self-defense is: BE POSITIVE CHANGE. Conduct yourself with responsibility, authority, and act powerfully according to what you believe and you will have a positive impact in the world and be able to protect yourself.\n\n",

        "description": "Multi-hyphenate Ted Fendt delivers on the promise of his acclaimed short films without sacrificing an ounce of his singular charm and rigor. Shooting on 16mm (blown up to 35mm), the writer-director-editor here focuses on Mike (Mike MacCherone), an ambitionless resident of Haddonfield, New Jersey, who finds himself subletting a friend’s room in Philadelphia and (ineptly) covering his shifts at a by-donation walking-tour company. Mike floats, as if in a trance, from one low-key comic folly to another, each one a strange and subtle moral tale. Fendt’s economy of expression, expert handling of his nonprofessional cast, and incomparable nose for the tragicomic dimension of the everyday distinguishes Short Stay as a truly anomalous work in contemporary American cinema: a film made entirely on its maker’s terms.\n\n\"\"This is slacker cinema for people who can't even be bothered to light a joint — in its own strange way a marvelous thing.\" — Calum Marsh, The Village Voice\"This stripped-down story of a less-than-dynamic man lets its gentle humor tip over into the excruciating again and again, functioning like a finely tuned moral tale whose tenderness for its characters doesn't mean it won't expose their shortcomings.\" — James Lattimer, Slant\n\n \n\n\"Short Stay does not feel like a bigger film than director Ted Fendt's charmingly ill-fitting shorts, but rather is a more robust, fuller in passing detail and commonplace incident. In other words: unassuming, but charged.\" — Daniel Kasman, MUBI Notebook\n",

When he asks students: “When you think about the future of our world, what do you feel - Hope, or Worry?” Very few hands go up for “hope”—almost all go up for “worry”. Our need as educators is to generate hope - to turn Gen W into Gen H.\n\nThe webinar will showcase the power of positive, inspiring solutions to the worries that are causing so many young people to lose hope, including the climate crisis, the wider ecological crisis, which includes the oceans filling up with plastic, and larger economic and political worries. It will show how, using a positive three-step approach, you can turn worry into hope, and then into action.\n\nGuy Dauncey is a futurist who works to develop a positive vision of a sustainable future, and to translate that vision into action.

        "description": "Made for just $55,000 and shot (and re-shot) over the course of three and half years, DARK STAR began life as final year thesis film by a pair of angry young USC film students named John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon. A decade before they redefined cinematic horror and science-fiction, Carpenter and O'Bannon collaborated on this messy, anarchic, counter-culture counterpunch to the candy-coated imperialism of STAR TREK and sterile, cerebral distance of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Instead of brave astronauts boldly going beyond the infinite, the crew of this titular space vessel are a bunch of crabby, bored and antisocial misfits. And rather than explore the strange new worlds they seek out, they just blow them up (aided by inexplicably sentient -- and hilariously enthusiastic -- thermostellar bombs).\n\nAlready settling into career-defining roles, Carpenter and O'Bannon colloborated on the witty, subversive screenplay, with Carpenter handling directing duties and composing the electronic score (his farty bass tracks are a highlight, though miles from the elegant simplicity that would soon become his sonic trademark). O'Bannon edited and contributed to the clever, if primitive, special effects, and, most memorably, played the central role of the hapless Sgt. Pinback.\n\nThe student film found its way into the hands of producer Jack Harris (THE BLOB), who felt it had commercial potential and asked for re-shoots to bring it up to feature length. Owing as much to the practicality of O'Bannon's presence as to creative choice, most of the reshoots centered around expanding Sgt. Pinback's misadventures with the ship's extraterrestrial mascot, a mischevious beachball alien (puppeteered by fellow USC alumni Nick Castle, later Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN and director of THE LAST STARFIGHTER).\n\nDespite Harris' instincts, DARK STAR was not a great success (\"We went from having the most impressive student film ever made to the least impressive commercial film ever made,\" O'Bannon would later say), and Carpenter and O'Bannon parted creative company shortly afterward (on less-than-friendly terms, if Jason Zinoman's book SHOCK VALUE is to believed).\n\nRegardless, both would soon find massive individual success in DARK STAR's wake. Fellow USC grad George Lucas was sufficiently impressed with O'Bannon's work to hire him as a special effects artist on STAR WARS. Carpenter had a moderate hit with ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, which of course led to HALLOWEEN, which at the time became the highest grossing independent film ever made. O'Bannon went from STAR WARS to Alejandro Jodorowsky's doomed adaptation of DUNE (where he first made the acquaintance of Swiss artist H.R. Giger) and channeled his frustrations with DARK STAR's threadbare production values and lacklustre reception into his screenplay STARBEAST, later renamed ALIEN, launching a game-changing film franchise that continues literally to this day.\n\nJoin us at The Royal for a very rare chance to see this low-fi sci-fi counter-culture cult classic on the big screen!\n",

        "description": "They are called “sister ferments.” Raw vinegar and kombucha ferment very similarly, the latter being effervescent and slightly sweet. One of the most popular among the fermented beverages, kombucha is a sugar-sweetened tea fermented by a culture of living organisms called a SCOBY (symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast.) This tonic is akin to raw vinegar.\n\nRaw vinegar is used to aid detoxification, to add as a sour flavor in foods, for cleaning and much more. It alkalizes our bodies and can be used as a remedy for a wide array of ailments or conditions. An acetic acid ferment, raw vinegar is simple to make. Yet commercially, it is almost always deprived of its live culture benefits.\n\nWe will learn about home brewing kombucha for beginners, plus dive into the art of second fermentation, techniques and methods to get your brew at its best. We will also learn how to make raw apple cider vinegar, which requires nothing more than apples and pure water. Live kombucha cultures will be available for you to take home, plus home brewing instructions to get your first batch going. Participants will also be able to taste all of our fermented food and beverages, all made locally. Space is limited, so be sure to sign up by February 13, 2017.\n",

Everyone, it seems - from Queen Victoria herself to Florence Nightingale and the serving men of the Crimea - understood the ‘sacred worth’ of a lock of hair from the head of a loved one.\n\nDrawing on material in the Florence Nightingale Museum and other public and private collections, artist Jane Wildgoose considers a wealth of intricately crafted watch-chains, lockets, necklaces, bracelets and rings containing human hair, and the ways in which these ‘precious relics’ spoke of ties of love, kinship, and loss during the Victorian era.\nAdmission price for all talks £8.00 (Members of the Florence Nightingale Museum FREE) and includes a glass of wine and a chance to view the museum. Doors will be open from 6pm, for a 6:30pm start.\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                        This lecture is part of our season of events for 'The Age of the Beard,' an exhibition and series of events generously funded by the Wellcome Trust.\n",

During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album \"Addiction\" in 2014.\n\nThey decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to \"Dubstep\" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album \"Hybrid Distillery\" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director \"Ebola - Delit2fuite\" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.\n\n*Suport*\n\nBoogie T.\n\nMore info TBA\n",

        "title": "Jerry Buting Presents ILLUSION OF JUSTICE w/ Robert Kolker",
        "description": "Please join us at WORD Jersey City for a reading, discussion, and Q&amp;A with one of the minds being Making of a Murder, Jerome Buting, to celebrate his new book THE ILLUSION OF JUSTICE. Buting will be joined in conversation by Robert Kolker of Bloomberg News.\n\nThe TV documentary phenomenon Making of a Murder, which debuted on Netflix in December 2015, explores the story of Steven Avery, a man from Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, who served 18 years in prison for the wrongful conviction of sexual assault and attempted murder of Penny Beerntsen, before being fully exonerated in 2003 by DNA evidence.  In 2005, Avery was arrested on charges of murdering Teresa Halbach, a local photographer, and convicted in 2007. Jerome F. Buting, who has served as a high-profile criminal defense attorney for 35 years, defended Avery in the murder trial. Despite his best efforts, and those of co-counsel Dean Strang, Avery was found guilty of first-degree intentional homicide and sentenced to life in prison in March 2007. \n\nNot since The Thin Blue Line has there been a true crime documentary as engrossing and provocative as Making a Murderer; Steven’s case cuts across demographic lines, and has galvanized as much debate about the integrity of our criminal justice system as it has about whether Steven Avery is guilty or innocent. In ILLUSION OF JUSTICE: Inside Making a Murderer and America’s Broken System (Harper, 2/28/2017), Buting provides an insider’s riveting narrative of the Avery case and that of his nephew, Brendan Dassey—and what the cameras did not capture—interwoven with the story of his own development as a criminal defense lawyer; as he reflects on his professional motivations and discusses other career-defining cases (including another, equally shocking wrongful conviction that he worked on with The Innocence Project), he provides commentary on the integrity of our law enforcement and legal systems. Together, his experiences shape a relevant analysis of the deeply flawed judicial system in which he practices.\n\nRobert Kolker is the New York Times bestselling author of Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery, a narrative-nonfiction chronicle of unsolved murder that was named one of the New York Times’ 100 Notable Books and one of Publisher's Weekly’s Top Ten Books of the year. An award-winning investigative journalist, he currently is a Projects &amp; Investigations reporter for Bloomberg News.\n\nJerome F. Buting is a shareholder in the Brookfield, Wisconsin law firm of Buting, Williams &amp; Stilling, S.C. He received his undergraduate degree in Forensic Studies from Indiana University and his law degree from the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill. He is a past board director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a past president of the Wisconsin Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and chair of the Wisconsin State Bar Criminal Law Section from 2005 to 2007. His present private practice is entirely criminal defense, both trials and appeals. He has defended the citizen accused in many serious high profile trial cases, including the Steven Avery case, and he obtained the reversal of convictions in State of Wisconsin v. Ted Oswald and State of Wisconsin v. Ralph Armstrong (reversing a 25 year old murder conviction). He lectures worldwide and is frequently sought after for his knowledge in the use of expert witnesses and DNA evidence. He is also the 2016 recipient of the Fierce Advocate Award from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n",

Women from different ages, social and cultural backgrounds, and professions are all welcome to participate. No previous sewing experience is required. All materials will be provided including: new kitchen cloths, embroidering thread, and embroidering needles. Participants are also welcome to bring their own used or new kitchen cloth, tea towel, or dish towel to embroider. \n\nEmbroidered pieces from this workshop can either be taken home by the participants or donated to Dana's collaborative large-scale textile installation called The Rags Between Us. \n\nDana has hosted and facilitated three embroidering circles where she collaborated with over 100 women to embroider old and new cloths while engaging in a deeply enriching experience, sharing time, labour, and conversations. In each occasion, our old rags and our most dear female relationships and narratives have been our muses of inspiration.\n\nAbout the FacilitatorDana Prieto is an Argentine artist and educator based in Toronto. She completed a BFA in Drawing and Painting at OCAD University.\n\nHer work circles around the mundane through the creation of spaces, images and actions that propose uncanny participatory experiences. Using ordinary materials such as food, litter and kitchen cloths, her projects reflect on both intimate and social-political issues around migration, belonging, gender and power.\n\nShe has participated in several award-winning collaborative projects working within diverse communities in Toronto, Halifax, Buenos Aires, Rawson, Quito and Belize.\n\n\n\nShe is currently coordinating Critical Soup, an interdisciplinary food-art initiative that opens dialogues about the impacts of Canadian extractive companies in Indigenous and Global South territories.\n\nFind out more on her website.\n\nImage: © 2015 Dana Prieto.\n",

        "description": "If every album serves as a single snapshot of an artist’s current\nseason, then Tenth Avenue North’s new album, \n\tFollowers (Provident Label\nGroup), is a Polaroid coming to life in full color. Brilliant hues of\nexuberance, confidence and unwavering hope saturate the band’s follow-up to\n2014’s \n\tCathedrals. Every cut finds Mike Donehey (lead vocals, guitar), Jeff Owen (guitar, vocals),\nBrendon Shirley (keys, vocals), Ruben Juarez (bass, vocals) and Jason Jamison\n(drums) basking in the pure joy discovered only in following Christ.\n\nTenth Avenue North has long been known for the depth and vulnerability of their songwriting since they released their acclaimed national debut, Over and Underneath, in 2008. Quickly winning fans’ allegiance with radio staples like “Love Is Here,” “Hold My Heart” and “By Your Side” (GMA’s 2010 Song of the Year), the band was named the Gospel Music Association’s New Artist of the Year in 2009. The group gained further momentum with three additional full-length records that spawned hits like “You Are More,” “Losing,” “Worn” and “No Man Is an Island,” among others, and has sold in excess of one million albums to date.\n\n\nConcert will take place in the main church. General Admission tickets will be available for purchase at the door, in addition to online. Doors open at 6:00pm. If you would like to pre-purchase tickets, but are unable to do so online, please contact Bryan in the parish office at 636-240-3721 x240. Seating is not assigned. \n\nSpecial guest Mary-Kate Buncher will open the show.\n\nVIP tickets get you: seating in front rows, PLUS formal reception before the concert with dinner, Q&amp;A, and short acoustic set with Tenth Avenue North. Reception will be held in the parish hall, located on the lower level of the main church. VIP ticket holders should arrive by 5:30pm for the reception. VIP tickets will not be available after Friday, May 12th. Buy them while they are still available!\n\nGeneral Admission tickets may be upgraded to VIP anytime prior to May 12th.\n\nDiscounts available for youth ministry members, seniors, and groups of 15 or more.

Have a drink, order some food, and be sure not miss the Costume Contest! \n\n8pm: MOVIE STARTS\n\nIt begins with an axe crashing into a TV set: sparks fly, a scream is heard, and the symbolism is brutally obvious - forget everything you thought you knew about the quirky, wacky, cosy world of TWIN PEAKS, cos Daddy's home and he's pissed off. Like many of the show's hardcore fans, David Lynch was disillusioned with what TWIN PEAKS had become: from a groundbreaking, excoriating peek into America's small-town underbelly to a cute parade of oddball soap-operatics in under two years. The big screen version gave him licence to bring it all back to basics, and he grabbed it with both hands: even in Lynch-land, with all its ear-severing, head-exploding, exploitation and rough sex, there's nothing so dark and demented as FIRE WALK WITH ME, now regarded as one of his best films -- a masterpiece alongside BLUE VELVET and MULHOLLAND DRIVE. The critics sneered, the fans balked and the public stayed away in droves. It's their loss: this was a beautiful new kind of madness, terrifying, exhausting and exhilarating in equal measure. BE WARNED THOUGH: If you do plan on watching the series, see it first; this film contains one helluva of a spoiler.\n\n*Non-alcoholic options available\n",

With each fundraiser, we endeavor to earmark funds to support, encourage and uplift our women, but we can do more, with your help.\n\nGoing beyond a support network.\n\nTWC endeavors to help women in the following ways:\n\n\n\tDown payments and/or closing cost assistance for a first-time, female homebuyer\n\tFunds for our honorees to assist other women who are going through similar medical and/or emotional experiences \n\tEntertainment events to help women unwind with music, fun and friends to get a short break from the pressures of being everything to everyone \n\nWe need your help.\n\nWe cannot do this alone and need partners to help us provide these grants. Your tax-deductible donation can go a long way and make a major difference.\n\nWe host 5-6 annual fundraisers to cover operating expenses for the organization, and provide financial resources for women we honor for their strength, courage and contribution to their communities.\n\nIt could be any one of us. \n\nOur commitment to continue helping these women is born out of the belief that it could be our mother, sister, daughter or friend struggling.  We take pride in empowering every woman we encounter and helping those we can directly impact with our organization.\n\nYour tax-deductible donation of $100 or more would help the women we serve help others; and, pay it forward!\n\nMany of the women directly impacted by TWC are professionals with businesses of their own. We stand with them as they build their businesses, fulfill their dreams of home ownership and move towards a more prosperous and fulfilling life.\n",

Both hailing from the Sunshine State, Smokepurpp is the oldest and more ahead of the two. Producer of others and his own tracks, he has countless songs over a million plays, which have led Smoke to be a real staple in the underground rap game. His high-energy he brings into his music and performances is a main reason why we are bringing him to Philly again. His style can be compared to a drill/demonic feel.  Purpp mainly started as a producer and then eventually began spitting on his tracks. Collabs with heavy artists like Xavier Wulf, Rich the Kid, Fat Nick and XXXtentacion soon followed. After taking his own career to flight, he started producing for Lil Pump and very quickly, Pump followed in Purpp's footsteps, gaining major exposure with the track \"LIL PUMP\". From there, collaborations with Famous Dex, Ugly God and Smokepurpp himself.  This will be Pump's FIRST time in Philly and Smokepurpp's second time!!!

While maintaining the integrity and hallmark passion of the genre, Belgo-Colombian Annabelle Lopez Ochoa imagines an original and explosive movement language premised upon the theme of communication between the sexes and performed to an original guitar composition by Eric Vaarzon Morel.\n\n\n\nFlabbergast (2001)\n\nChoreography by Gustavo Ramírez Sansano\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nLatin lounge meets spontaneous combustion in this quirky yet joyful piece set to the music of Juan García Esquivel. Inspired by his experience of coming to America for the first time, choreographer Gustavo Ramírez Sansano exposes with humor our stereotypes and preconceived ideas about new and foreign places. Flabbergast is dedicated to the choreographer's mother, who taught him how to dance the bayón.\n\n\n\nClub Havana (2000)\n\nChoreography by Pedro Ruiz\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nA portrait of the glamorous Havana of the 1950s during the heyday of Cuban music, dance and nightlife. The intoxicating rhythms of the conga, rumba, mambo, and cha cha are brought to life by choreographer Pedro Ruiz, a native of Cuba, in this re-imagined nightclub filled with the exhilarating sounds, colors and ambience of that golden era.\n\n\n\nAsuka (2011)\n\nChoreography by Eduardo Vilaro\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\nAsuka is a celebration of the music of Celia Cruz through the lens of the Latino experience. Cruz, renowned as the \"Queen of Salsa,\" captured the heart of Latinos the world over and became a symbol of perseverance for many. Through rich imagery and humor, Eduardo Vilaro explores the struggles of departure from one’s homeland and the exuberance of success experienced by a community.\n\n\n\nAbout Ballet Hispánico:\nAmerica’s premier Latino dance organization for more than 45 years, Ballet Hispánico brings communities together to celebrate and explore Latino cultures and the shared human experience through dance. Founded by National Medal of Arts recipient Tina Ramirez, Ballet Hispánico has been led since 2009 by Artistic Director &amp; CEO Eduardo Vilaro, who has infused the organization’s legacy with a bold and eclectic brand of contemporary dance that reflects America’s changing cultural landscape.

To save his mother, Alex transforms the family apartment into an island of the past, a kind of socialist museum where his mother is lovingly duped into believing that nothing has changed. What begins as a little white lie gets out of hand as mum wants to watch TV and even leaves her bed one day...\n\nIn a wonderful, touching and comic manner, the multi-award-winning Good Bye Lenin! tells the story of how a loving son tries to move mountains to restore his mother to health - and keep her in the belief that Lenin really did win after all.\n",

        "title": "Michael Schatte with Shawn Dore in the Blues in Small Spaces Series",
        "description": "Michael:\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Michael Schatte (pronounced SHAW-tee) has emerged as one of the most compelling guitarists and singer/songwriters on the North American roots music scene. Since early 2015, when he was a top-eight finalist at the Memphis International Blues Challenge and performed at Tennessee’s historic Orpheum Theatre, Schatte has appeared on some of the continent’s best festival and theatre stages, winning new fans and a reputation for world-class musicianship by way of more than 200 concerts in Canada and the United States. Though Schatte loves the blues (and evidently does it well), it’s just one ingredient in what he calls Eclectic Electric Roots Music, a brew of original rock, blues, celtic, bluegrass, country and rockabilly he’s been writing, recording, and performing throughout his career.\n\nThis unique blend of genres is delivered with stunning impact on his latest studio album, Turn Back the Vikings. Recorded in his home base of Toronto and mixed in Austin, Texas by Simon Tassano (the live and studio engineer of choice for folk-rock legend Richard Thompson, whose Sam Jones is the sole cover song on Vikings), the new album is Michael’s finest work to date, prompting Britain’s Blues Matters! magazine to call him “one of the best undiscovered songwriters of our times.” Intelligent lyrics, hook-filled arrangements, and Schatte’s rich singing voice certainly have a way of capturing attention, but it’s his work on a certain six-string plank of wood that ties it all together musically.\n\nA respected and fiery guitarist, Schatte has developed the habit of leaving audience jaws agape. He’s been compared to world-class players decades his senior, and counts Peter Green, Danny Gatton, Albert Lee, Mark Knopfler and of course the aforementioned Richard Thompson as major influences on both his electric and acoustic fingerstyle playing. Reviewing a recent concert at Aeolian Hall in London, The Beat Magazine described Schatte as “one of Canada’s best-kept secrets and certainly one of its most skilled rock performers,” citing his “masterful manipulation of the guitar” and a vocal style “as polished as his picking.”\n\n\n\nShawn:\n\nJaw dropping guitar and vocals with grooves that live forever! Shawn \"Deepwater\" Dore is a solo artist that performs a folk blues / country blues type mix of covers (Robert Johnson, Booker White, Muddy Waters, etc.) as well as a great selection of originals from his solo album \"Less is More\", and from the \"Watch My Back\" album recorded with the Shawn Dore Band. Also having the ability to involve and connect with the audience, you will surely leave a Deepwater Dore show with a lasting impression.\n\n*Shawn was a competitor representing the Loyal Blues Fellowship at the 2014 International Blues Challenge in Memphis TN, and was one of the acts selected for a showcase performance on Beale Street in Memphis.\n\n“Shawn Dore is a musician, who’s passion shows through, as he plays and sings with reckless abandon every time he hit’s the stage.”-Erin McCallum, musician, winner of the 2012 International Songwriting Competition, 2 time Canadian Maple Blues Award nominee, 2 time Ontario Independent Music Award nominee.\n",

Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n",

And unlike larger annual TEDx events, our salons focus on an issue, even a question that’s of interest. Short and sweet, each event lasts a couple of hours rather than being an all-day affair. Though the salon’s flexible nature allows it to take varied forms, salon attendees always watch a selection of TED Talks, and occasionally a few live speakers, followed by discussions about the ideas. In 2017, we plan to host Salon events that are timely, hinging on a specific topics in the news.\n\n\n\n\tFree\n\n\n\n",

What truly horrible lives they must lead.”\n\nThe master of debauchery, Charles Bukowski, drags us kicking and screaming into the seedy underbelly of Hollywood in this pitch black comedy. Stunningly photographed by the master of neon himself, Robby Müller, and boasting tremendous performances from Mickey Rourke and the always-radiant Faye Dunaway, this is one booze-soaked odyssey you won’t want to miss. Beer and whiskey will be served!\n\nHenry Chinaski, a poet and alcoholic, spends his life in Los Angeles bars. One day he meets and falls in love with Wanda, also an alcoholic. Together they meet Tully Sorenson, who publishes some of Henry's poems, bringing Henry a brief shot at fame and fortune. But, Henry and Wanda have only one real goal in life: drinking to numb the pain they feel outside the bars of Los Angeles.\n\nThis screening and others are made possible thanks to our wonderful sponsors Sonic Boom and Hollywood Suite, and alcohol will be flowing courtesy of Monarch Tavern.

This event is independently organized without supervision or financial support from TED.\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)\n\nTED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.\n\nAt a TED conference, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian Greene, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Three major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Vancouver, Canada, simultaneous with TEDActive, in Whistler, BC; and the TEDGlobal Conference takes place each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nOn TED.com, talks from TED conferences are shared with the world for free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday. Through the Open Translation Project, TED Talks are subtitled by volunteers worldwide into more than 90 languages. Through our distribution networks, TED Talks are shared on TV, radio, Netflix and many websites.\n\nThe TEDx initiative grants free licenses to people around the world to organize TED-style events in their communities with TED Talks and live speakers. More than 5,000 TEDx events have been held, and selected talks from these events are also turned into TED Talks videos.\n\nThe annual TED Prize grants $1 million to an exceptional individual with a wish to change the world. The TED Fellows program helps world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. TED-Ed creates short video lessons by pairing master teachers with animators, for use in classroom instruction or independent learning.\n\nFor information about TED's upcoming conferences, visit www.ted.com/registration\n\nFollow TED on Twitter at http://twitter.com/TEDTalks, or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TED.\n",

        "description": "Dylan Ireland's debut full length album 'Ontario', (Express &amp; Company) which embraces sounds of traditional Canadian roots rock, has been in rotation on over 125 stations across North America. In summer 2013 their debut single ''Carry Me Along' spent 14 weeks on the CBC Radio 2 Top 20 alongside names like Mumford &amp; Sons, David Bowie and Blue Rodeo, reaching as high as #5. While also reaching #1 on CBC Radio 3 R3-30 and Rock Charts. Dylan has toured across Canada from P.E.I to Dawson City, and south to Austin Texas for SXSW 2012. As a touring band, or Dylan solo, he has graced stages across Canada including Mariposa Folk Festival, NXNE, SXSW, Halifax Pop Explosion, and a Home Routes concert series throughout the Yukon Territory. All well sharing stages with the likes of The Sadies, Whitehorse, Tom Wilson, Joel Plaskett and Greg Keelor, have allowed a true, organic sound to develop. 2013 Peterborough Folk Festivals Emerging Artist 2013 Mariposa Folk Festival Emerging Artist 2013 Wire Award folk/country Band Of The Year\n\nIn her second, full length album, independent artist, Kayla Howran, from Peterborough, Ontario, offers her most genuine work yet – Spare Parts - 10 songs written from the heart in an alt-country/folk-roots genre, produced by Colin Cripps (Blue Rodeo, Kathleen Edwards and Junkhouse,) recorded at The Tragically Hip's studio, The Bathouse, in Bath, Ontario and featuring other notable players such as Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano) on pedal steel, Anna Ruddick (Randy Bachman, Ladies of the Canyon) on bass, Derek Downham (Ron Sexsmith, Whitehorse) on drums/percussion/piano/organ, and Dylan Ireland (Express and Company) on acoustic guitar and background vocals. Spare Parts is due to be released officially, March 2017.\n\nKayla Howran's music has drawn comparisons to Kathleen Edwards, Lindi Ortega, and Neko Case. Listeners will recognize Howran's signature country inflection throughout Spare Parts; but will also hear a matured, alternative aspect to her voice, style, and songwriting.\n\n\"Kayla is a rare, dynamic case of dynamic antipode, wherein the darker and quieter she takes a song, the more powerful it becomes. Her music commands repeat listens, so your ears can savour and soak in every scar, smile and tear.\" Derek Downham (Canadian producer/musician)\n\n“Howran’s vocal chops and ease with melodies rise quickly to the top of the mix, a tender yet confident timbre set to highway-paced grooves, giving Spare Parts that cruising, open road feeling.” Mike Dunn (BEATROUTE Magazine AB)\n",

        "description": "WHAT IS AUDIOFEED?\nAudiofeed Festival is music, arts, and community.\n\nMusic and Art is at the center of what we tangibly “do”.  Since our founding in 2013, we’ve hosted over 300 bands, screened movies, explored performance and visual art, and created space for our audience to share their music and art.\n\nOur goal is to create an environment where unconditional love is nurtured, encouraged, and shared without regard for appearance, religious belief, race, societal status, or any other thing that separates us from each other in the world at large.  We believe that the perfect example of that Love was expressed through Jesus Christ and we do our best in fitful and imperfect ways to follow His example.   Exploration, questioning, doubts, fears, hopes, joys… all are welcomed and encouraged.  Ultimately we’re people who want to support each other and experience great music and art with others who feel the same way.\n\nWHAT KIND OF MUSIC?\nIts not necessarily “radio single” type material.  From really mellow acoustic to hardcore and everything in between.  With three stages focusing on different styles, there is something for almost everyone almost all the time.  Some of our artists are expressly Christian.  Many are not, but write music influenced by their faith journey.  Some are expressly not Christian, but share our values of love and community and are working all of that out in the best way they can figure out.  We like people like that.\n\nHOW DID IT START?\nAudiofeed began in 2013 in an effort to keep the core “family” of the Cornerstone Festivals of the past alive.  Audiofeed is not Cornerstone.  But it’s the same family, and similar spirit.\n\nWHAT ORGANIZATION SPONSORS/RUNS AUDIOFEED?\nWe formed a non-profit in 2014 to help us accept donations, but there is nothing behind Audiofeed but a handful of volunteers and the community that gathers each year.  We are you.\n\nIS THIS APPROPRIATE FOR FAMILIES/CHILDREN?\nFor sure, this is a faith-based music and arts festival; however, there are people here from all walks of life. Children 11 and under are FREE.\n",

Six factors are associated with brain change in adults: (1) focus and repetition, (2) creating and maintaining a collaborative alliance, (3) inducing moderate levels of anxiety, (4) facilitating multiple levels of emotional activation, (5) creating \"profound moments of meeting\" and (6) developing a coherent life narrative.\"\nPatricia Coughlin, 2016\n\nConfirmed presenters so far include: Patricia Coughlin, Kristin Osborn, Jessica Bolton, Torben Palmer Hansen, Angela Cooper and Diane Byster.  This group of inspiring trainers will share groundbreaking theory and techniques to enable you to maximise your effectiveness working with complex clinical presentations.\n\nIn this exciting immersion course two days of presentations of theory and clinical practice are followed by two days of small group workshops.  Experiential learning enhances retention and application; so our approach enables you to learn about the theory as well as to develop your clinical work in way that is personal and attuned.\n\n\n\nEarly bird and IEDTA members discounts available, with limited places for workshops and students.\n\nhttp://www.summerimmersion.thrivepsychotherapy.co.uk\n\n\n\nWe have a choice of workshops during Wednesday and Thursday which you need to sign up for when you register due to limited numbers.  Please click below for more information.\n\nWednesday 14th June 2017\nPatricia Coughlin - Who are you really? Why do you do what you do?\n\nThe best therapists are not only highly educated and skilled, but are an authentic and engaged presence.  This experiential workshop is designed to help you get clear about who you really are, while discarding old, limiting beliefs that hamper, rather than support you, in being your best self.\n\nDr Angela Cooper - Working with Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS): Beginners workshop\n\nThis workshop will cover basic theory and practice as applied to patients with low to moderate MUS. We will develop an understanding of what MUS are and how they develop, you will be offered a framework to assess unconscious processes and how they link to various MUS, as well as a framework to understand your own emotions. You will also learn some basic treatment skills that you can apply safely with appropriate patients.\n\nTorben Palmer Hansen - Investigating Resistance to Change in Therapy\n\nThis workshop demonstrates the transformation from resisting change to allowing change with theory, video excerpts of actual therapy sessions and experiential exercises.  Torben will teach therapeutic techniques to support your clinical practice and relieve therapeutic work which has become stuck due to resistance within the client and / or therapist.\n\nThursday 15th June 2017\nKristin Osborn - Building Bridges Between Clients and Clinicians: How increasing your emotional aptitude influences the therapeutic alliance\n\nNeuroscience, attachment and psychotherapy research indicates that the therapeutic alliance is at the heart of treatment. You’ll learn how and why cultivating your own capacity for self-compassion, self-care and emotional experiencing helps you resonate more fully with your clients so they can experience change. You’ll learn how non-verbal interplay can guide you when facing a client who is experiencing intense emotions. By the end of this workshop, you’ll feel more comfortable being yourself ‘in session'.\n\nDr Angela Cooper - Working with Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS): Advanced workshop\n\nThis workshop with cover more advanced theory regarding the development and maintenance of MUS.  We will look at more complex MUS presentations where medical, psychological and social factors intertwine and how we can use an assessment framework to determine if emotional factors are present, how they might be contributing to symptoms and how we might target those areas in treatment.  We will look closely at the effective aspects of treatment and what is required depending on a patient’s response to intervention.\n\nDr. Jessica Bolton - Using Deliberate Practice to Increase Capacity and Improve Outcomes\n\nPractice! It's how the good become great, and how we all become good.   We wouldn’t expect to learn to play an instrument by going to concerts or by only performing whole pieces to an audience.  This workshop will show you how to use Deliberate Practice to enhance your development, your clinical practice and your outcomes.  The workshop will emphasize experiential learning through role-plays, watching video material, including of your own clinical work.\n\nDiane Byster -Building Awareness and Healing Trauma: Integrating Yoga Principles and Practice Into Psychotherapy\n\nThis workshop will demonstrate how basic principles and practices from yoga can be incorporated into experiential psychotherapy.  You will learn essential principles from yoga that apply to trauma as well as understand when and how to use yoga breathing, simple, gentle movement practice, and mindful self-compassion techniques.\n",

But Lisa’s innocent act masks the fact that she’s looking to bring Johnny down, and her manipulations are tearing Johnny apart. As Lisa informs her cancer-ridden mother, Claudette, that Johnny hit her (and he did not hit her, that is bull$&amp;*t, he did not!), Johnny’s best friend, Mark, finds his resistance to Lisa’s seductive charms weakening. Meanwhile, local orphan Denny looks up to Johnny, and needs the older man’s help after the teen rips off a drug dealer. What kind of drugs? It doesn’t matter. Then guys play football in tuxedos, because you can play football anywhere. This movie is seriously not to be missed.\n\nTommy Wiseau’s misguided masterpiece subverts the rules of filmmaking with a boundless enthusiasm that renders such mundanities as acting, screenwriting, and cinematography utterly irrelevant.

The play introduces us to seven high-achieving teenagers at a fee-paying grammar school. They are holed up in the Upper School library, tucked away from supervision, revising — or not, as the case may be — for their mock A-Levels.\n\nWilliam, a bright Oxbridge-hopeful, falls for the enigmatic new girl Lilly, but she’s falling for someone else. Watched by his girlfriend Cissy, Bennett bullies the unconfident Tanya and the awkward prodigy Chadwick.\n\nIt is a recognisable stew of rivalries, desires and confusions, each character’s uncertainties carefully drawn. But as exam pressure builds, anxiety flares up into aggression, revealing a raw undercurrent of panic and hostility.\n\nPunk Rock premiered in 2009 at the Lyric Hammersmith, London.\"\n",

Doors open at 9 PM. $8 advance. $10 at the door.\n\nLittlebirds\n\nWhat began with two college buddies performing drunken living room improv jam sessions has quickly evolved into Littlebirds, a six piece band hailing from the Windy City. Littlebirds amplifies a classic americana sound by layering in violin melodies, heavy hitting guitar synchronization, and 3 &amp; 4 part vocal harmonies. If John Prine, Twenty One Pilots, Mumford, and Mumford's sons had an incestual orgy resulting in an illegitimate child, Littlebirds would be that offspring. The band may be silly, they will most likely be drunk, but regardless of circumstances, they absolutely will be fun.\n\nKeith Scott Blues\n\nKeith Scott is a celebrated blues musician. Personality has been at his craft for the last 30 years. Originally from White Plains,N.Y., he made it to college in Gainesville, Fl where he met Muddy waters and Bo Diddley. With the inspiration of his music heroes he proceeded to relocate to Chicago to pursue his musical journey. While hanging on the scene at the Checkerboard Lounge and Teresa's, Keith met and jammed with blues legends such as Buddy guy, Junior wells, James Cotton and Little Milton. It wasn't long before he began touring with the Jimmy Dawkins Blues Band performing  throughout much of the world. In Chicago, Robert Plant attended one of the shows completing his musical dreams!! Keith currently tours, records and performs his own brand of blues inspired music at clubs including House of Blues, Hard Rock Cafe and festivals throughout the US and Canada.\n",

DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\n\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\n\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n",

Together, we will identify our sector’s most pressing challenges and find new and innovative ways to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for Canada’s young people.\n\nABOUT THE 2017 SUMMIT\n\nThe Sandbox Project is proud to partner with the Children and Youth in Challenging Contexts (CYCC) Network for our most interactive event yet. Wisdom2Action (W2A) is an event format designed by the CYCC Network to facilitate cross-sectoral knowledge sharing and connection building across the child and youth serving sector.\n\nThe W2A approach provides a unique opportunity for participants to meet face to face, share practice-based evidence, evidence-based knowledge, and local knowledge and build lasting connections. Part of the day will be devoted to breaking into Open Space – a small group discussion format. At this time, we’ll be inviting participants to host a conversation on a topic of their choice, or to share their own promising practice, lessons learned, or challenges we can overcome together. No PowerPoints necessary!\n\nWe are happy to be joined once again by Canadian Olympian and Sandbox Project Board Director, Martin Reader, who will serve as our MC for the day.\n\n2017 THEME: FAIRNESS FOR CHILDREN\n\nUNICEF’s latest Report Card, Fairness for Children, found that Canada is one of the most unequal societies for children and youth, ranking 26th of 35 affluent nations. Inequality limits the potential of children broadly – not only those who fall farthest behind. If we close the inequality gaps between children in the middle and those at the bottom, overall child well-being should improve for all of Canada’s kids. Each of us has experience and insight to share as we work toward closing the inequality gaps – from the community level through to the federal level.\n\nOur lunchtime discussion will provide a unique opportunity to inform current research on the state of child and youth health and wellbeing in Canada. We will use design thinking techniques to generate ideas and explore trends that will help shape the Canadian Index of Child and Youth Wellbeing led by UNICEF Canada.\n\n\n\nThank you to TELUS, the AstraZeneca Young Health Program, Yellow Pages Canada and the Mental Health Commission of Canada for their generous support of the 2017 Sandbox Summit.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "Den multiplatinumselgende rockeartisten Bryan Adams kommer til Oslo Spektrum 9. Feb 2017! \n\nSuperstjernen og hitkometen tar turen innom Norge og Oslo Spektrum som en del av hans ”Get Up Tour”. Dette blir et show fullspekket av nye og gamle låter.\n\nBryan Adams gav ut sitt 13ende studioalbum ”Get Up” oktober 2015 til flotte anmeldelser i både USA og Europa. Albumet er produsert av ELO frontmann Jeff Lynne og skrevet sammen med sin skrivepartner gjennom mange år, Jim Wallace. Albumet består av 9 nye låter og 4 akustiske versjoner inkludert låtene ”You Belong To Me”, ”Brand New Day” og ”Dont Even Try”. \n\n”Det er en bekymringsløshet over dette albumet. På mange måter er dette det albumet jeg skulle ønske jeg var i stand til å lage 25 år siden” – Bryan Adams\n\nDen kanadiske rockesangeren og låtskriveren har brukt de tre siste tiårene til å lage musikkhistorie. Han har solgt mer en 100 millioner plater og singler, turnert verden over og fått nummer 1# status i over 40 land. Karrieren startet for 30 år siden med utgivelsen av debutplaten, «Bryan Adams», men det var først med tredjealbumet, « Cuts Like A Knife», at han virkelig slo igjennom internasjonalt. Året etter ble hans mest suksessfulle album «Reckless» utgitt. Suksessalbumet inneholdt blant annet hitlåtene «Run To You», «Heaven», «Summer Of 69», «Somebody» og «It`s Only Love». Albumet solgte til tre ganger platinum i hjemlandet, og endret Bryan Adams liv for alltid. Siden den gang har han blitt nominert til – og vunnet - flere Grammys og blitt hedret med en stjerne på the Walk of Fame i Los Angeles.\n\n“Etter to timer og 32 låter hadde Bryan Adams det så moro på scenen at det ikke så ut til at han var klar for å avslutte kvelden i det hele tatt” – The Sun, UK\n\n”Dette showet har mottatt strålende kritikker verden over. Vi er utrolig begeistret for å få ham tilbake til Norge. Forvent en kveld med allsang og god gammel Rock & Roll stemning” – Per Osmundsvaag, arrangør – Atomic Soul\n\nGled dere til en minnerik kveld i Oslo Spektrum med en av verdens dyktigste artister!\n\nBilletter i salg 31.

        "description": "DESCRIPTION\nHello and welcome all to the 5 week public speaking beginners course! We have a very friendly, supportive and non-judgmental environment, which is a great place to begin your public speaking journey.\n\nThis course will follow an approach of having relaxation/mediation exercises in the first hour, fun and slightly challenging exercises in the second hour, leaving the final hour for improvised speeches. This course has a very practical approach giving the speakers plenty of opportunities to speak. We believe practice makes perfect.\n\nPublic speaking is a very useful skill to develop in life. It not only helps you to do things such as presentations at work and university but also develops your inner qualities in other areas of life allowing you also to improve your social relationships with people, as you learn how to express yourself better.\n\nEven if you are not interested particularly in public speaking, this course is great for building confidence.\n\nWhat to expect from this course\n\nEach week we will cover and practice in detail each of the following pillars of a confident public speaker:\n\n· Breath and pace\n\n· Voice projection\n\n· Physicality (body language and eye contact)\n\n· Content (structure)\n\n· Intention and congruency\n\n· Emotions and tone variety\n\nWe will constantly monitor your progress throughout this course and discuss them with you. Tailored-made exercises will be made for each speaker, depending on his/her's needs. In the last class of the course you will have the opportunity to prepare a speech for the class. If you have done well and you feel comfortable to advance you will have the opportunity to join the next stage improvers course.\n\nWho is the course aimed at\n\nThis course is aimed at people who fear public speaking and are complete beginners with no or very small public speaking experience.\n\nShy, anxious and introverted individuals are most welcome!\n\nPrice and Payment details\n\n3 hours x 5 sessions, working out at £12 per hour.\n\nTo book the course you need to pay a £60 deposit, remaining £130 can be paid throughout the course*\n\nTo book:\n\n£60deposit (to book your place) + £130 on the course\n\nDeposit can be paid here on Eventbrite:\n\nDates\n\nOn Tuesday's: beginning the 14th of February from 18:30-21:15 for the following 5 Tuesday's.\n\nSize of class\n\nApproximately 14 people\n\nWhat you will be able to do by the end of the course\n\n· Feel much more confident about your public speaking\n\n· Know how to handle your fears\n\n· Deliver a 2-3 minute presentation in front of a small audience\n\nOur Philosophy\n\nA small note on our philosophy on how we approach in helping people to overcome their fears; We do not mould our speakers into a one fits all model, where we try to shape you into someone who you are not. Our principles are grounded in authenticity, where we encourage our attendees to express and grow more of their authentic selves. In the class we aim to identify what is authentic and natural to our speakers and we focus on brining more of that out, which enables our attendees to identify their natural speaking style. The way we achieve this is by encouraging our participants to explore being vulnerable and experiment with how it feels to have 'your guard' down. We believe being vulnerable = strength and not weakness. Instead of always attempting to be someone who we are not, which forces us to hide certain qualities from the public we encourage our attendees to be themselves, because what we are is already as great and 'full' as we can be. When we aim to be more, or change/hide our weaknesses we allow our fears and anxieties to prosper. Hence, our goal is to help people reach a place of self-worth, self-love and self acceptance. In short learning to be vulnerable is a big theme underlying our philosophy.\n\nShould you prepare or bring anything:\n\nNo. Just bring is a willingness to grow and challenge yourself! That is the best to overcome your fears.\n\nBackground about the facilitator:\n\n\n\nMichael Sokolin holds a BA in Entrepreneurship and Management and a MA in Consultancy and Coaching. He has previously worked as a management consultant in A.T. Kearney and managed an international team in the strategy department of Groupon.\n\nTraining as an actor, Michael has constructed a strategic step-by-step approach for gaining more confidence in public speaking. His training draws from actor's training in drama schools, various public speaking methodologies, improvised comedy training.\n\nMichael's goal is to identify your weakest areas, and focus mainly on them, so you can grow your confidence in the most proven and practical way.\n",

        "description": "Drunk On Fiction is a journey, a quest, a mission, an adventure and an escape. \n\nThis new work for six dance artists is an examination of the powerfully addictive world of fiction and fantasy. Recycled plots, clichés and storylines that we see over and over again keep us yearning to escape from the mudanity of our lives. Drunk On Fiction dramatizes the personal stories of the performers to create a fictional version of themselves. These newly formed 'characters' model those we often see in both popular science fiction and fantasy. However this is only the beginning, the starting point of the adventure. \n \nThis bold and theatrical new dance work takes audiences on an emotional and imaginative journey. It reveals and speaks to the struggle for survival and purpose that we as humans, continue to battle with each day. In a way, we have all been heroes or villains at one point in our own lives. We are constantly starring in our own sagas, sequels and trilogies. Drunk On Fiction runs wild. It chases and fights it's way through worlds of fiction, to find its way to fact.\n\n \nFebruary 8-11 @ 8pm\nArts & Letters Club, 14 Elm St\n\nTHE GROWL REVIVAL pre-show gala reception on opening night*, 6:30-7:30pm - Hosted by CTV's Todd van der Heyden,cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, performances by Blunt Chunks, Michael Caldwell and more!\n\nFriday's performance is followed by a moderated discussion\n\nSaturday's performance is followed by a catered reception\n\n\nTickets:\n\nLimited Seating, please purchase tickets in advance\n\n$20-$25, available for purchase online below, or with cash only payment at the door\n\n*$45, THE GROWL REVIVAL opening night pre-show Gala reception 6:30pm (a limited number of regular priced 'show only' tickets are available)\n\n\nFeaturing:\nSocial Growl Dance, choreographer: Riley Sims\n\nPerformances by: Jean-Benoit Labrecque, Jolyane Langlois, Ana Groppler, Geneviève Robitaille, Kay Kenney, Sébastien Provencher\n\nMusic composed by: Caitlin Woelfle - O'Brien (Blunt Chunks)\n\nOutside Eye and Mentor: Tedd Robinson\n\nLighting Design: Fraser Mackinnon\n\nStage Management: A.J.

Starting production at the age of 13, Styn is no new comer in the scene. Being influenced by the names of Pete Rock, J Dilla, 9th Wonder & Madlib, Styn only produced hip hop at first. Not wanting to limit himself to just one genre, Styn also started to produce diffrent genres. He started to produce dubstep at the age of 16. Nowadays, Styn is better known as a dubstep producer rather than a hip hop producer.\n\nStyn continues to break down barriers between genres, regularly gaining support for his Dubstep, Trap, and various other styles of electronic music and hop hop from top industry producers including UZ, 12th Planet, Getter, Borgore, Gentelmens Club, p0gman, Bukez Finezt, Shiverz, and more! His production has seen releases on Buygore, Monsters, Arcane, and Courteous Family.\n\nInternationally known, Styn has smashed the decks across the globe at numerous gigs in countries including France, Russia, Belgium, USA, Germany, and Czech Republic just to name a few. With a plethora of production under his belt including originals and official remixes, Styn is a major force in the Bass Music scene.\n\n� BERRIX (Antwerp, Belgium)\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BerrixOfficial\nhttps://soundcloud.com/berrix\n\nDubstep artist from Belgium, Berrix is most known for his dj abilities & mixdowns, forging the way with his controversial technical style. “Berrix produces all sorts of Dubstep that wobbles & womps through your body, making you dance whether you want to or not.”\n\nBerrix experienced his first love for dubstep around 2007-2008 and only started making dubstep himself in 2014, taking all sorts of styles along the way with him but keeping the hard hitting dancefloor destruction sound as his personal favorite. Berrix may only be 2 years into the game, however his signature sound has gained him tons of international support. With releases on: Full Flex Audio, Blacklight Audio, Bewildered & Dub Selection, he has been getting overall support from the likes of Shiverz, Bukez Finezt, Akira, Styn, Kahlil, Jakes, Blankface, AD, Infekt, SubFiltronik, Badphaze, BloodThinnerz, Stinkahbell and many more. Berrix signature style has quickly become a staple in the riddim dubstep scene.\n\nThe phenomenon is still growing, Berrix is becoming an upcoming legend of the dubstep scene. With an incredibly loyal fan base he's is known world wide for working hard, playing hard and DJing hard on stages globally. \n\nPlus support from:\nNOTIXX\nBLACKMASK\nANGRY EYEZ\nSTACKS b2b TOMMY TRILLFIGER\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\nFRIDAY FEB 10th 2017\n@ Venu (75 West Chippewa St. Buffalo, NY 14202)\nDoors @ 8:00pm // 18+ Event\nTickets starting @ $15\n2 Story Venue / State Of The Art Sound & Lights / LED Dance Floor\nTickets available at ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1405192\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬",

The Michel film also features the exact moment Kanye West morphed from “College Dropout” to the Yeezus that we know and love today.\n\nMUSICALE – (noun) a program of music performed at a party – is a monthly film series at The Royal.\n",

Alex Moskos + ZONES + Doom Tickler\n\nSaturday, February 11, 2017\nDoors: 7pm | Concert: 8pm\nThe Music Gallery, 197 John St.\nTickets: $15 Regular | $10 Members/Students |$13 Advance at musicgallery.org\n\nPleasence Records, co-founded by James Lindsay and Deirdre O’Sullivan, is a label dedicated to underground experimentation based in Toronto. The music walks a fine line between pop and experimental, respecting the past while looking forward to (im)possible futures. This showcase also promises immersive visuals from multidisciplinary artist Vanessa Rieger (co-founder of The White House Project and the safe space project Nightlifeguard) and Randy Gagne aka Man Made Hill, last seen here as Randy the Tongue in performance art ensemble Stillboys.\n\nAlexander Moskos is a long-standing participant in Montreal’s experimental music community. He has performed and recorded his own songs under the name Drainolith, with the noise rock band AIDS Wolf. Moskos has toured constantly over the past few years and released recordings on labels like NNA, American Tapes, and Drag City. This show is a rare solo piano outing, drawing from his first album of solo piano compositions, Military Terms, released on Pleasence Records in 2015. \n\nZONES began as a sphere of sonic exploration established in the summer of 2012 by Toronto-based multi-media artist Derek McKeon. Working as ZONES, McKeon weaves hypnotic loops and psychedelic textures together to create a marbling of pop hooks in a kaleidoscopic haze. ZONES’ latest album, After Image, was released on Pleasence Records in 2016. \n\nDoom Tickler, Leslie Predy, is a Toronto-based artist who strives to create a primal musical experience that pushes the limits of sounds a human body can create. She utters twisted vocals from another planet, like all the cats on the internet blended into a digital grinder. These are the sounds of your stomach turning, bubbling like a soup & eating itself. This is dark, foreboding music.\n\nVisuals sponsored by MOOG audio",

        "title": "Young The Giant w/ Lewis Del Mar at The Bourbon",
        "description": "w/ Lewis Del Mar\nDoors: 7 p.m. || Show: 8 p.m.\nAll Ages || $27.50: Advance || $32: Day of Show\n$2 Minor Fee at the door\nTickets On-Sale Friday, November 18th @ 10 a.m.\n\nThe Bourbon Theatre presents...\n\n::: Young the Giant :::\n\nThere comes a time in a young band's life when they hit that sweet spot where their voice, their sound, and their unity as a band gel perfectly. For Los Angeles-based indie rockers Young the Giant, that time is now. This trifecta of musical magic manifests itself on the band's third album, Home of the Strange, on Fueled by Ramen. \n\n\"With these new songs, we've fully embraced what it is to be lyricists. We're not trying to combine fiction writing and lyricism anymore,\" explains singer Sameer Gadhia, who minored in fiction writing at Stanford University where he studied human biology before dropping out to pursue music. “We’ve also taken a collective approach to the thematic and lyrical development of each song on this album. Most of these songs came together during the demo process at either Seahorse Studios in downtown Los Angeles where Francois, Eric and I would spend hours collaborating over coffee on the rooftop, or at our producer’s home studio in West Los Angeles where we would do the same on his back patio. We used to view songwriting more like being a fly on the wall and not being in the story. But, on this record, we're in the story more than ever. It's personal, but universal at the same time.\"\n\nThe new record not only displays the group's new heights as lyricists and communicators, but it shows a rich, musical growth for the band as well. \"We've always struggled to really capture what we do live on record. We accomplish that on this release. Now that we're on our third album we finally figured out how we need to work together. It helped that we had a theme and we all kept on that path in one solid mindset throughout the process.\" \n\nThe theme of Home of the Strange is of the modern American immigrant story. It's especially relevant to the quintet as they're from different ethnic backgrounds and most are immigrants or first-generation Americans. Gadhia is Indian-American, Jacob Tilley (guitar) is British, Eric Cannata (guitar/vocals) is a New Jersey-born Italian-Jewish, Payam Doostzadeh (bass) is Persian-American, and Francois Comtois (drums/vocals) is French-Canadian. But, it also speaks to anyone who feels like they don't belong, or feels marginalized, angry about the state of affairs of our nation (especially in this polarizing election year), or hopeless about a better future. \n\nOn \"Amerika,\" for instance, the band explores the idea of the American dream and how to reconcile that with the various cultures they each grew up with. The song, which USA Today named one of the 10 Best Songs of the Week, was inspired by Franz Kafka's unfinished novel of the same name. It's the story of a 16-year-old boy named Karl who flees Germany under uncertain circumstances looking for a better life in New York and struggles to find a place to belong between the two cultures. \n\n\"We find ourselves searching for our own ethics in between the often-contradictory beliefs of this polarized American Modern Age and those of the romanticized cultures of our forefathers,\" reveals Gadhia, whom The New York Times declared \"one of the great contemporary rock voices.\" \"Our perspective is irreversibly tinged with this rhetoric of the immigrant conscience and guilt. Searching for the 'American dream' is to lust for excess, power, and sex. We realize that when we achieve our goals, they often leave us more hollow than before.\"\n\n\"Home of the Strange,\" meanwhile, is a tongue-in-cheek play on the national anthem. \"I've always had to reconcile the ideals of my Indian culture that my parents tried to instill in me with what it means to be American and figuring out what my American dream is. There was always a conflict of where it is that I exist. Am I American? Am I Indian? I always felt that I was somewhere in-between. I wanted to find a place to belong.\"\n\n\"Something to Believe In\" was inspired by conversations with students they met at colleges in 2015 while performing on tour. It’s about being brave enough to forge your own path if the one we're raised to follow fails. \"Everybody wants something to believe in,\" he says. \"But what many of us are taught to believe in - go to school, get a job, have a family - doesn't always work. Kids are coming out of college with serious debt and jobs are scarce. They're realizing the dream is broken. It can be liberating and scary at the same time to carve your own path instead.\" \n\nThe album's most hopeful song, \"Repeat,\" is a call to action to not repeat history. \"The only times people tend to make big changes is when they must - when they are faced with something greater than themselves. Things seem bad now with environmental issues, the economy, the job market, but sometimes the best changes come when we are at our lowest,\" says Gadhia.\n\nMusically, the band came into the recording sessions with a specific sonic vision. \"We wanted a full, live band sound, but at the same time really direct and up-front. It's the perfect combination of old school and new school. It's like a contemporary hi-fi record. We finally achieved that live sound we'd been touching upon on previous records, but it's full realized on this one,\" says Gadhia of the sessions with producer Alex Salibian (Elle King, Mikky Ekko) and executive producer Jeff Bhasker (Kanye West, Jay Z, fun.), who won the 2016 Grammy Award for Producer of the Year for his work with Mark Ronson and Nate Ruess, among others.\n\nThe band also finally figured out how to truly write together as a band. \"Most bands don't actually write together,\" notes Gadhia. \"It's a great concept, but it wasn't until this record that we actually fully achieved it. Our new producer Alex really helped us get there. We realized the genesis of a song or its end point can come from any member. And we all switched around, too. We played different instruments. I played a Hammond organ on 'Amerika,' and Jacob played vibraphone while Francois sang the verse. Overall, Fran and Eric sang and wrote more this time around. It's really our most collaborative effort.\" \n \nSince the band's 2010 inception, Young the Giant has made a name for itself in rock as the \"thinking man's band,\" winning over fans, radio, and press with their incendiary live shows, strong musicianship, and poignant lyrics. The band's 2010 self-titled debut, which reached No. 6 on the Rock and Alternative album charts, featured the RIAA Gold-certified hits, \"Cough Syrup\" and \"My Body,\" which peaked at No. 2 and No. 4, respectively on Alternative Radio. The band's sophomore release 2014's Mind Over Matter hit No. 7 on The Billboard 200 and spawned the hits, \"It's About Time,\" which reached No. 2 on the Alternative Radio chart and the title track, which hit No. 15. \n\nEven with chart successes, critical praise (Rolling Stone, Billboard), coveted television appearances (The Late Show with David Letterman, MTV Video Music Awards), and high profile festivals (Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo), Young the Giant still feel like they have a lot more to do and, more important, a lot more to say as a band.\n\n\"We have a platform and we have our own beliefs, but at the same time, what's amazing about songwriting, music, or literature is that it brings people together and it shows people that everyone has the same problems and wants the same thing. This record is really a call to consciousness to really understand our predicament,\" adds Gadhia.",

Tickets are $7.\n\nSynopsis: Amélie is a fanciful comedy from Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the acclaimed director of A Very Long Engagement and The City of Lost Children. He invokes his incomparable visionary style to capture the exquisite charm and mystery of modern-day Paris through the eyes of a beautiful ingenue (Audrey Tautou). Her life changes course when she discovers an old box of childhood treasures, anonymously returns it to its rightful owner, and watches from a distance as his life is transformed by the discovery. Thus begins her odyssey: a series of inventive plans to straighten out other people's lives—mostly for the better (if they've earned it) and occasionally for the worse (if they deserve it). But she always hides behind a veil of mystery and anonymity, which works well for her, until she meets an intriguing young man (Mathieu Kassovitz). Will she have the courage to do for herself what she has done for others? (Fully subtitled)",

Inspired by creative processes developed by the '60’s Fluxus art movement, each “temporary solution” is a visual/textual poem contained in a Flux-kit (a cigar box collaged with stenciled imagery and typewritten letters). We follow Tim, Jeffrey, and AO in a flurry of street art, secret messages, and performance scores in a poetic, radical fight for survival.",

We have all the ingredients and participants required to build a future that is the envy of the rest of the world. Strong digital identity technologies, processes and partnerships will be the foundation of a robust digital economy. We call upon all attendees of IdentityNorth 2017 to seize the opportunity that is before us: affirm Canada’s place leading the development and adoption of robust, scalable, privacy-enhancing digital identity ecosystems that serve the needs of all stakeholders, securing digital transactions.\n\nThe IdentityNorth 2017 Agenda is currently in development. Presenters are invited to submit proposals for this two-day forum. Day One will feature presentations by leading identity and digital economy experts from Canada and around the world. That evening we will host The Leaders Dinner and Awards, honouring the visionaries who have led and continue to shape the Canadian and global identity space. Day Two is an “unconference” in which attendees leverage the incredible expertise and talent at IdentityNorth to collaborate to identify and tackle the hottest topics and thorniest challenges in digital identity.\n\nWhy Become a Partner\n\nIdentityNorth is Canada’s leading forum for individuals and organizations interested in digital identity and the digital economy. It is an important platform to share the ideas and knowledge that will drive Canada’s digital future. The forum delivers high value content through its subject matter experts, keynotes and an “unconference” day - a participant driven event where attendees build the agenda and lead inspiring and insightful sessions on contemporary identity topics. Sponsoring IdentityNorth is the best way to engage the digital identification community and raise the level of brand awareness of your company and its role building Canada’s digital economy.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at IdentityNorth 2017!\n\nAran Hamilton \n\nPartnership Benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBenefits\n\t\n\n\n\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t Platinum Partner (1) $25,000 \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLead sponsorship of the Leaders' Dinner \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOpportunity to provide greetings at the Leaders Dinner \n\t\t\tPriority Seating at Leaders' Dinner\n\t\t\tYour logo featured on signage on site at the dinner and forum \n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier displayed on the IdentityNorth website \n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier on all printed/electronic event material \n\t\t\tOpportunity to provide one item to the attendee thank you package\n\t\t\tOpportunity to develop pre-event content\n\t\t\t4 complimentary passes to IdentityNorth 2017\n\t\t\tSponsor discount for 4 additional passes\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t Diamond Partners (3) $12,000 \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLead sponsorship of one of: Day 1 Lunch, Day 2 Lunch, Unconference \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRecognition of your sponsorship at your event – including signage and verbal recognition\n\t\t\tPriority Seating at Leaders' Dinner\n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier prominently displayed on signage at the forum location \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier displayed on the IdentityNorth website \n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier on all printed/electronic forum material \n\t\t\tOpportunity to develop pre-event content\n\t\t\tOpportunity to provide one item to the attendee thank you package \n\t\t\t3 complimentary passes to IdentityNorth 2017\n\t\t\tSponsor discount for 4 additional passes\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t Gold Partners (3) $8,000 \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLead sponsor of one of: Day 1 Breakfast, Cocktails, Day 2 Breakfast\n\t\t\tVerbal recognition of your sponsorship at the event\n\t\t\tYour logo prominently displayed on signage at the forum location \n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier displayed on the IdentityNorth website \n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier on all printed/electronic forum material \n\t\t\tOpportunity to develop pre-event content\n\t\t\tOpportunity to provide one item to the attendee thank you package \n\t\t\t3 complimentary passes to IdentityNorth 2017\n\t\t\tSponsor discount for 2 additional passes\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t Silver Partners (4) $5,000 \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier displayed on signage at the forum location \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier displayed on the IdentityNorth website \n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier on all printed/electronic forum material \n\t\t\tOpportunity to provide one item to the attendee thank you package \n\t\t\t2 complimentary passes to IdentityNorth 2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t Speaker Partners (4) $3,000\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier displayed on the IdentityNorth website \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYour logo and sponsorship tier on all printed/electronic forum material \n\t\t\tOpportunity to provide one item to the attendee thank you package \n\t\t\t2 complimentary passes to IdentityNorth 2017\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n",

Participants will learn the fundamentals of AM of polymers, metals, composites, and biomaterials, and will realize how process capabilities (rate, cost, quality) are determined by the material characteristics, process parameters, and machine designs. Application areas including aerospace components, electronics, medical devices, and consumer products will be discussed via detailed examples and case studies. Particular emphasis will be placed on metal- and powder-based AM technologies, and related design principles and process standards to achieve high-performance materials and novel properties via AM. Lab sessions will provide hands-on experience with a variety of state-of-the-art AM equipment. Participants will design, fabricate, and measure test parts, and will perform experiments to explore process limits. The course will conclude with discussion of how AM will influence existing business models in design and manufacturing, will pose major opportunities and needs for advancement.\n",

Apporté par le leader des dispositifs de sécurité et des meilleurs Brouilleur GSM de signal.Remarques importantes concernant la distance de brouillage: Les distances de brouillage mentionnées sur le site Web ne sont que pour la référence du client. La distance de brouillage réelle sera modifiée en fonction de la puissance du signal et de l'emplacement d'utilisation et si les charges sont complètes, etc.Remarques importantes pour les brouilleurs portables sans ventilateur de refroidissement: N'utilisez pas le brouilleur lorsqu'il est en charge, sinon il brûlera le brouilleur car il n'a pas de ventilateur intégré. Si en raison de ce facteur en raison de la rupture du brouilleur 4g , le client perdra l'autorité de répartition libre.Ce qui est important, c'est que ce brouilleur peut également être utilisé pour personnaliser les bandes de fréquences que vous souhaitez. Bienvenue à fournir des fréquences et nous allons personnaliser pour vous.\n\n\n\nUn dispositif de brouillage GPS ou un brouilleur GPS est généralement un petit émetteur autonome qui génère un signal d'interférence de 1575,42 Mhz sur un rayon de 5 à 10 mètres.Habituellement, l'utilisateur branche le Brouilleur GPS dans un allume-cigare et place l'unité suffisamment près d'un dispositif de poursuite GPS pour perturber le signal satellite GPS. Une fois sous tension, ils deviennent entièrement opérationnels en moins de 20 secondes. La puissance relativement faible et le temps de démarrage rapide permettent d'utiliser les brouilleurs uniquement si nécessaire. Les criminels les désactiveront dès que possible pour éviter la détection. Ces brouilleurs peuvent être achetés à bon marché sur Internet pour moins de 100 $.Une détection plus immédiate des brouilleurs est également disponible. Le module GPS des unités Geotab GO6 et GO7 dispose d'une fonction de détection de brouillage qui va déclencher la signalisation d'un journal de débogage par notre appareil. Cela peut être trouvé dans les détails du journal de MyGeotab, apparaissant comme: GpsJammingDetected.\n\nPour une surveillance simplifiée du brouillage et d'autres problèmes GPS, une règle d'exception peut être créée dans MyGeotab. Cette règle génère un rapport d'exception et peut déclencher une alerte ou un courrier électronique pour l'événement.\n\nDans une tentative de bloquer son employeur de suivre son camion de travail, résident du New Jersey est une amende de 32 000 $ pour l'utilisation d'un brouilleur GPS illégale.Les brouilleurs GPS sont illégaux aux États-Unis en raison de leur capacité à bloquer les communications importantes. Et pour un homme du New Jersey, le coût était beaucoup plus élevé que prévu.Tout d'abord, le Brouilleur Signal a empêché son employeur de suivre son allégeance pendant son quart de travail. La société qu'il travaille pour les dispositifs de suivi GPS installés sur tous les camions de travail, y compris celui qu'il conduisait. Ils ont fait cela afin de surveiller l'emplacement des camions et d'autres données, et être sûr que le temps de l'entreprise a été utilisé avec sagesse.\n",

Their greatest hits include: \n\n•\t“I Want You To Want Me”\n•\t“I’m Not Gonna Miss You” \n•\t“Dream Police”\n•\t“Surrender”\n•\t“California Man”\n\nFrontlined since 1974 by Robin Zander (vocals, rhythm guitar), Rick Nielsen (lead guitar), and Tom Petersson (bass guitar), the Rockford, IL- born band is set to impact still another era with the spectacular new BANG ZOOM CRAZY…HELLO, their 27th studio collection and first in more than five years. \nAfter more than half a decade away from the studio, Cheap Trick was fired up and ridiculously prolific, cranking out close to 30 new tunes over two pair of sessions in Los Angeles and Nashville. Tracks like “No Direction Home” hit hard as a teenage crush’s kiss, affirming the eternal strength of Cheap Trick’s smart, sly, sometimes sarcastic songcraft. Each member has skin in the songwriting game, contributing elements – a riff, a chorus, a hook that won’t stop – which are then jammed into three-and-a-half minute pop perfection by the entire unit, ensuring everybody’s respective two cents are represented in every finished tune.\n\nTicket Information:\nTickets range from $47.50 to $110.00 plus applicable service charges. Tickets are available by visiting the Genesee Theatre Box Office, all Ticketmaster outlets, Ticketmaster.com & Ticketmaster charge by phone at 800-982-2787.",

        "description": "Coach one-on-one with Rashmi (women only)We all have patterns  which we repeat but deep down within you, you know there is more. You  have reached a point in your life where you no longer willing to settle  for mediocre connections in relationships anymore.Let’s just go  ahead and admit it, we all want a real meaningful connecting  relationship with ourselves, with others and potential to embrace our  sexuality full on.Reality is, the quality of every relationship  begins with you. There is no need to wait for the perfect partner to  come along to engage in Tantric practice. The discovery and  transformation always begins in your own self (body-mind) first. As you  learn to connect with all parts of yourself in deeper ways. You will  have more access to love &amp; pleasure with or without a partner. And  the energy you learn how to cultivate will make you more radiant and  powerful. Which has helped many of my students/clients attract the  relationship they desire.For those of us who have devoted  years of our lives to self-development and spiritual growth, we often  find that no matter how much self-awareness we have cultivated we are  still not experiencing the relationships &amp; sex-life we long for…  even worse, we know that the old models of ‘spicing up your sex life’  are not authentic to us…Who do we even go to with our very real questions about how to navigate sex &amp; relationships in a new way or approach?Coaching  one-on-one with me can support you in creating deeply fulfilling,  aligned, intimacy-rich relationships (beginning with yourself) that  break-through the deformed model we have been handed over and make way  for a new approach of relating relationships grounded in truth and love.I call this program “Awakening within” package. There are multiple session options available. These sessions can be redeemed in person at Sacred Garden's home studio or on Skype.This work is for you if you are interested in:   * Quieting your mind   *  Unlocking your whole body orgasmic potential    *  Awakening your sexual desire    *  Inspired Creativity   *  Ease of Manifestation   *  Dissolving body discomfort or shame around sexuality   *  Relationships grounded in intimacy &amp; connection     *  Being honored and cherished by a romantic partner     *  Cultivating your Feminine and Masculine energy    *  Finding Forgiveness    *  Radiant Beauty    *  A renewable inner well of energy    *  Feeling at home in your body regardless wherever you goThis work is not for you if:    *  You are looking for a magic pill to fix yourself.    *  You are looking for a magic pill to fix your partner.    *  You don’t want to be responsible for transforming your life.    *  You are looking for new sexual techniques to 'get off'.    *  You just want to feel good, without having to feel anything  else.    *  You are attached to what you already know about yourself, or how sex &amp; relationship work.After  each session a toolkit for the week/homework, a specialized practice  crafted just for you to continue going deeper will be given.

        "title": "2-4 person Couple/Domestic Harmony with Tantra",
        "description": "Many domestic partnerships as well as romantic partnerships, especially long-term ones, are full of challenges. The  tension we accumulate in day-to-day life and the ideas and beliefs we  accumulate about our loved ones or partner can destroys the love and  domestic harmony. It's particularly erodes desire and intimacy we once  felt with our romantic partners. As we stay in partnership the richness  comes from learning how to turn challenges into opportunities for deeper  intimacy. Through small group or family sessions you and your loved  ones/partner will learn how to re-connect to the present moment and  each other, which can literally breathe new life into a romance as well  as our mindsets in daily modern life. These custom sessions  lasts little over 2 hours and are designed to hold the space for  transformation within you and your partner (Romantic partner or family  member).This work is for you if you are interested in:   * Quieting your mind   *  Unlocking your whole body orgasmic potential    *  Awakening your sexual desire    *  Inspired Creativity   *  Ease of Manifestation   *  Dissolving body discomfort or shame around sexuality   *  Relationships grounded in intimacy &amp; connection     *  Being honored and cherished by a romantic partner     *  Cultivating your Feminine and Masculine energy    *  Finding Forgiveness    *  Radiant Beauty    *  A renewable inner well of energy    *  Feeling at home in your body regardless wherever you goThis work is not for you if:    *  You are looking for a magic pill to fix yourself.    *  You are looking for a magic pill to fix your partner.    *  You don’t want to be responsible for transforming your life.    *  You are looking for new sexual techniques to 'get off'.    *  You just want to feel good, without having to feel anything  else.    *  You are attached to what you already know about yourself, or how sex &amp; relationship work.If you or your loved ones booked more than one session, then after  each session a toolkit for the week/homework, a specialized practice  crafted just for you to continue going deeper will be given. feedbacks are encouraged.These sessions can be redeemed in person at Sacred Garden's home studio or on Skype.NOTE: ALL sessions/exercises are fully clothed with no sexual contact.All major credit cards, checks and cash are acceptedClick here for more information about Sacred Garden of Tantra:http://sacredgarden.strikingly.com/",

        "description": "*Scroll down for English*\nLe Comiccon de Montréal est un événement destiné aux amateurs de culture populaire à l’occasion duquel ces derniers ont la chance de rencontrer des artistes et de voir un large éventail de produits issus de l’univers du divertissement : science-fiction, horreur, anime, jeux vidéo sous toutes leurs formes et, bien sûr, bandes dessinées et comic books. On y trouve une grande diversité d’exposants, notamment des entreprises qui y présentent leurs marchandises, ainsi que des véhicules ou d’autres éléments marquants de films ou de séries télévisées. Il s’agit d’une occasion unique pour les collectionneurs de trouver le tee-shirt, le comic book, le jouet, la figurine, le DVD ou Blu-ray ou la réplique dont ils rêvent. \n \nLes aficionados de comic books et de bandes dessinées ont quant à eux la chance de rencontrer leurs artistes préférés, de demander leur autographe, d’acheter un dessin ou de les remercier pour leur travail. L’un des points marquants de l’événement est certes la possibilité pour les visiteurs de rencontrer les artisans mêmes de leur émission de télé ou de leur film préféré. Les vedettes participent à des séances de photo et de signature d’autographes, et donnent des conférences accueillant de 700 à 3 000 personnes.\n\nOn encourage les visiteurs (sans les obliger, toutefois) à se costumer sous les traits de leur icône de la culture populaire préférée (cinéma, télé, jeu vidéo ou comic book, par exemple). Le défilé de costumes atteint son apogée lors de la mascarade, grand concours de costumes présidé par des juges venus des quatre coins du monde qui notent plus de 60 concurrents devant les encouragements de près de 3 000 amateurs réunis pour l’occasion.\n \nPendant les trois jours de l’événement, les visiteurs sont invités à plus de 100 groupes de discussion et ateliers visant la promotion des comic books, des costumes, des jeux vidéo et de la culture populaire en général. Une zone de jeux vidéo est aménagée pour ceux et celles qui voudraient découvrir des jeux en démonstration, participer à des tournois ou simplement profiter d’une séance de jeu gratuite. Les démonstrations sur place et les tournois de jeux vidéo de sport englobent à la fois des jeux indépendants et des titres parmi les plus prisés. Dans l’ensemble des longs et courts métrages présentés, notons des films d’amateurs ainsi que des productions indépendantes et de grands studios. \n\n*English*\n\nMontreal Comiccon is a pop-culture fan convention that showcases artists and products from entertainment genres like: Sci-fi, Horror, Anime, Gaming in all its forms, and, of course, bande dessinée and comic books.

The company is always a welcome addition, and this is their third visit to the Sony Centre since their Toronto debut in 2013, and an auspicious one as they celebrate their 40th Anniversary. Inspired by one of the 20th century’s greatest ballerinas, Olga Spessivtseva, Boris Eifman’s choreographic love letter to Spessivtseva’s tragic life draws parallels to the classic ballet Giselle, but is also a springboard for larger themes of politics vs. art and public vs. private personas in the age of celebrity. Red Giselle features Eifman’s signature choreography filled with highly charged performances and searing routines with “exuberant theatricality, boldly expressive movement and extraordinary dancing.” – Vogue.

        "description": "SABATON “THE LAST TOUR” 2017 \n+ VERY SPECIAL GUEST: ACCEPT\nSUPPORT: TWILIGHT FORCE\nVALBY  HALLEN\n21. MARTS 2017\n\nDen svenske krigsmaskine SABATON er på vej mod den absolutte elite i heavy metal verdenen. De platinsælgende Falun-baserede heavy-metalhelte har sommeren over headlinet de største festivaler, og spillet stadionkoncerter for tusindvis af entusiastiske fans med legendariske kolleger som IRON MAIDEN og SCORPIONS. Her i august vil SABATON endnu engang stå i front for Rockstad Falun Festival - aka Sabaton Open Air, når bandet er værter ved deres egen tredages festival, hvor de lukker festivalen den sidste dag med en eksplosiv optræden. Senere på året, vil SABATON sætte kurs mod staterne, hvor bandet skal spille en stor turné samt optræde på Ozzfest Meets Knotfest Festival i Californien, side om side med BLACK SABBATH, SLIPKNOT med flere.\n\nMen det er kun begyndelsen, for når vinteren kommer, vil SABBATON udfolde deres prestigefyldte livekræfter i Europa. Ingen nåde vil blive givet, og alle kanonerne bliver brændende varme, når denne utrættelige dræbermaskine, vil blæse de europæiske arenaer til en anden dimension. På denne tour med titlen ”The Last Tour”, vil de tyske metal-legender i ACCEPT komme med som support, og i København slår vi til marts dørene op i Valby Hallen, og byder velkommen til en aften i metallens tegn.\n\nBetyder det så at det er den sidste tour for SABATON? Nej det gør det ikke, da bandets verdensomspændende krigsplaner allerede strækker flere år frem i tiden.\nTitlen på denne massive turné kommer fra SABATONs seneste mesterværk ”The Last Sound”. Det nye album udkommer 19. august, på et af verdens mest ansete metal labels Nuclear Blast Records, og er den perfekte udviddelse af SABATONs diskografi, der allerede indeholder noget af det mest heroiske heavy metal man kender.\n \nSABATONs bassist Pär Sundström: \n„We have just finished our new album, which is titled THE LAST STAND and we know we have done a great album, which all fans of SABATON can appreciate for many years. If it is the best album of us, time will tell… But what we can tell for sure is that THE LAST TOUR will be the biggest and best tour of SABATON ever. It is the tour we have been looking forward to do for all these years!“\n \nACCEPTs guitarist Wolf Hoffmann: „Accepting a tour with SABATON is the result of a very cool relationship we have with the band. It was a great pleasure to tour with them in USA and we followed their career with respect over the years. We have not seen a band who has such a clear vision where they want to go and it is rare that bands can translate their visions into real action. SABATON are a hard working band and are a serious role model for aspiring musicians and young bands. We are looking forward to have an exciting tour - especially after we have been in the studio for a while and sure feel some kind of cabin fever…“\n\nBilletpriser: 350 kr. + gebyr \nBilletsalget starter fredag 5. august kl. 10.00 via livenation.dk og ticketmaster.dk",

It has sold 250,000 tickets in the U.S. to date with 75 venues completely selling out. The fun-filled show brings the hit TV series to life on stage, giving families the opportunity to engage with their favorite characters like never before for in an unforgettable first live theater experience. \n\n“Peppa Pig’s Big Splash has been so successful because kids adore interacting with the characters on stage. Just like the incredibly popular TV series, the live show is funny, lighthearted and a delight for the whole family,” said Jonathan Shank, Executive Producer, Red Light Management.\n\n“Peppa Pig’s Big Splash is everything fans love and expect from the TV show combined with the excitement of live theater,” said Lib Campbell, the actress who beat out 2,000 people who auditioned to play the role of Peppa Pig live on stage. “Everyone gets the chance to jump in muddy puddles with Peppa and sing along with Polly Parrot. Fans at each show can be seen singing and dancing in the aisles.” \n\n“The live show features a lively blend of costumed characters and puppets that walk, talk, dance, and jump up and down to give audiences a unique, interactive theatrical experience from the moment we open the curtain,” said Director Richard Lewis. “Peppa Pig’s Big Splash is a fully immersive musical production featuring a dozen familiar and original songs, as well as a sing-a-long.”\n\nIn Peppa Pig’s Big Splash, the nursery roof is leaking and Peppa and her friends need to fix it quickly. They set up a fair to raise money so Mr. Bull can do the repairs. There’s plenty of fun to be had as Peppa, George, Mummy and Daddy Pig, along with Danny Dog, Pedro Pony and Suzy Sheep work together to organize an exciting day out complete with a Champion Puddle Jumping Competition judged by Mr. Potato, where everyone gets wet! An interactive experience full of singing, dancing, games, and muddy puddles, Peppa Pig’s Big Splash is a guaranteed oinktastic blast for the whole family.\n\nEpisodes of Peppa Pig currently air on the Nick Jr. channel, in nearly 73 million households daily.\n\nStay up to date with Live Nation!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/livenationbritishcolumbia\nhttps://twitter.com/livenationwest\nhttps://instagram.com/livenationbc\nwww.livenation.com",

Their reunion has been enthusiastically embraced by the public, thanks to a hot band, some superlative new material, and a stage repertoire that draws heavily upon their much-cherished catalogue of Zombies and solo hits.\n \nIn their day, the Zombies were one of the few English bands of the 1960s that enjoyed true global popularity, with two American number ones, chart records throughout the rest of the world, and a deep and lasting affection for their music. For instance, in early 1967, at a time when their career had almost ground to a halt in the UK, the band played to crowds of over 30,000 in the Philippines. And ironically, right after the band split, their final single “Time Of The Season” quickly became their biggest record – US radio plays for the latter song recently passed the four million mark. The Zombies’ first two American singles, “She’s Not There” and “Tell Her No”, also remain two of the most-heavily spun vintage hits on American classic-rock radio.\n  \nTheir return to the concert stage is of particular importance to fans, since many never had the opportunity to see the band live during its brief existence in the 60’s (especially since a large number of their fans were born after the original line-up disbanded!).  Their live performances were recently captured on a double CD and DVD, Live At The Bloomsbury Theatre (released in the U.S. by Rhino in 2007), and their appearances in North America have included the “Little Steven’s Underground Garage” and “HippieFest” tours, as well a stint for Rod Argent in the 2006 line-up of Ringo Starr’s “All-Star Band”.\n \nMarch 2008 marked a true celebration of joining the old and the new, when the current Zombies line-up was joined onstage by the other surviving original members, bassist Chris White and drummer Hugh Grundy, for a series of special concerts at London’s Shepherds Bush Empire, which featured the first-ever live performances of Odessey & Oracle in its entirety.  This momentous event, awaited by many for decades, was filmed for a future DVD release, and was attended by fans ranging from Robert Plant to members of Snow Patrol.\n \nThe Zombies are cited by the mercurial Courtney Love; and as influences by Badly Drawn Boy, Paul Weller, Super Furry Animals, Magic Numbers, Billy Joel, She & Him, Foo Fighters, Fleet Foxes, The Vaccines and the Arctic Monkeys, among others. Recorded for their Golddiggers album, The Beautiful South released their version of “This Will Be Our Year” as a single. Just recently, Neko Case and Nick Cave recorded “She’s Not There” for the premier episode of HBO’s ‘True Blood’ fourth season.  The Zombies’ songs are regularly covered live by such varied artists as Beck, She & Him and Belle & Sebastian, and used in films and TV shows (‘Dear Wendy,’ ‘Awakenings,’ ‘Kill Bill 2,’ ‘The Simpson,’ among others – evidence that their music really is as fresh and relevant today as it ever was.\n \nColin Blunstone…Rod Argent…The Zombies – two seasoned pop veterans, backed by an exemplary band, with a show that not only pays open tribute to the much cherished highlights of their unequalled musical legacy, but also continues the tradition with new music cut from the same cloth: a treat for pop fans any way you slice it.\n\nStay up to date with Live Nation!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/livenationbritishcolumbia\nhttps://twitter.com/livenationwest\nhttps://instagram.com/livenationbc\nwww.livenation.com\n\nFollow the Commodore Ballroom:\nhttp://www.commodoreballroom.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/commodoreballroom\nhttps://twitter.com/commodorevcr\nhttp://instagram.com/commodoreballroom",

I have had more earth shattering breakthroughs, more deep healing…more understanding of who I am than ever before.  I have stopped using drugs and alcohol, stopped gambling…stopped hating myself.

If you feel that you leap into things without thinking and keep getting burned, than Trilotherapy will also help you with that. It helps you so that your brain and heart can get on the same page and be allies working towards the same goals, instead of at odds against each other. It's a new practice but I have already noticed the results of it and I'm just getting started. I feel like I'm helping myself more, and fighting myself less. Jeri is a great facilitator and teacher of Trilotherapy. She makes you feel welcome and warm. There is no judgement with her and it's a safe space to be in.

So she has extensive knowledge on Trilotherapy and is equipped with the proper tools to teach this wonderfully. She teaches it because she has experienced it herself and knows that it works.

During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album \"Addiction\" in 2014. \n\nThey decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to \"Dubstep\" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album \"Hybrid Distillery\" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director \"Ebola - Delit2fuite\" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.\n\n_____________________________________________",

It’s glitchy, it’s dubby, it’s trappy, and it’s been driving people absolutely wild. One of the most prominent artists responsible for driving this movement forward with his amazingly creative and hard hitting music is G Jones. Since 2012, this Santa Cruz native has been shaking up the underground scene something fierce, and in no time at all has risen to become one of the Bay areas hottest artists. Recently, his latest album Eyes, along with uniquely diverse collabs with Bleep Bloop, Grimblee, Mad Zach, & the Widdler have been receiving massive support from big names like Zeds Dead, Dj Shadow, Nastynasty, & Pretty Lights. When he plays live, no G Jones show is ever the same, his on the fly remixes and breakdowns of his own music keeps the crowd on their toes and begging for more long after he’s done.\n\n\n++ Yheti ++\n\nYheti live performances are an ever morphing detailed sound sculpture that plays with the souls of those open to the more experimental, surreal, low end heavy side of electronic music. I feel that ecstatic dance can be a liberating experience for anyone and intend to create that environment through high energy, deep rhythms, and soul driven melodies.\n\n++ SAYER ++ \n\nSayer has spent his entire life creating and evolving from music. Heavily inﬂuenced by his punk and metal background, he’s carved out his own space between bass, trap, and grime in the electronic landscape, making some of the most unique dance music coming out of the west coast. With a large catalog of heavy hitters to be released in 2016, he is a force threatening building foundations, startling nearby pets and causing dance ﬂoor feet to move uncontrollably.",
