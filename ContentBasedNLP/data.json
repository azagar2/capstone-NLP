The question of the ongoing need for spaces for culturally specific media arts exhibition and their relevance to future generations of independent Latin-Canadian filmmakers is being questioned, and this question will serve as the starting point for discussion on this panel.Panelists include notable Latin American media artist and programmers such as Ricardo Acosta, Alejandro Ronceria, Jorge Lozano, and Sinara Rozo.With this special program we aim to showcase the achievements and talent of our filmmakers and their integral role in the artistic identity of the Canadian cultural panorama.

More than a decade in the making, Klahr’s densely constructed magnum opus is “a valiant attempt to reconcile the existential mysteries of the past with the enduring burdens of the human condition” (Jordan Cronk, Cinema Scope), and “one of the finest cinematic achievements of the year” (Manohla Dargis, New York Times). Sixty Six is cover featured in the latest issue of Cinema Scope.Named one of the top five experimental filmmakers of the 2000s by Film Comment, Lewis Klahr is a Los Angeles-based artist and Guggenheim Fellow who has been hand-making films since 1977. Specializing in collage, he has exhibited internationally, including at the Whitney Biennial, and his work has been purchased by New York’s Museum of Modern Art, where Sixty Six debuted in December.",

Yes, please.  Repurposing a genre in ways as authentic as they are inventive is a feat, and everything about Darkness on the Edge of Town is a surprise wrapped in a subverted convention.  There is something familiar in the accomplished handling of dark themes, the dead-eyed vow to avenge a sibling’s death, the crackling danger that permeates every scene – and yet the variations are what elevate this tale and let you know you’re watching something truly special.

For those accustomed to haute cuisine, bone marrow, kidneys, and trotters aren’t anything new. But for those who cling to the notion that sirloin, chicken breast, and pork chops are all the only things our fair farm friends have to offer, there’s a whole new meat on the table. But it’s not just about novelty, or gluttony, for that matter. Utilizing every part of a beast is the epitome of sustainability. Eating everything is sustainable eating. \n\nChef Trish Gill thrives on the challenge of cooking with non-prime cuts: it takes a lot of knowledge of all tastes, textures and nutritional values in order to present the exquisitely tasting dishes on this edition of Toronto PopUp:\n\nCurious Cuts: A five course tasting menu. A lighter &amp; brighter take on the usual decadence associated with this type of cuisine, using it more as an accent to the gorgeous fruit &amp; vegetable season we are entering into! Trish carefully composed the menu in order to make this a very reasonably priced meal: great food should be accessible. In celebration of Ontario Craft Beer week, beer pairings are available with your ticket purchase, as well as wine pairings. \n\nTrish was most recently the Chef de Cuisine at the Samuel J Moore restaurant, Sous Chef at Beast Restaurant, and is currently working with Chef Charlotte Langley at Catch Seafood Restaurant. She was also involved with Death Row Meals Supper Club, doing collaborative dinners with restaurants such as La Carnita, Rock Lobster, Luma, The Hawthorne, Keriwa Cafe and more. She was part of the all-female crew of Chef Alexandra Feswick's The Dinner Party, and has assisted in dinners put on by The Group of 7 Chefs. She is very passionate about using high quality, local &amp; ethically sourced ingredients, and loves showcasing what Ontario has to offer.\n\nWe can accommodate guten-free and dairy-free requests, as well other sensitivities by request with reasonable notice. \n\nCraft beer &amp; wine pairings as well as special cocktails available.\nTicket price includes taxes.

What are the features of such “hauntings,” and how might we gain some further foothold on a more conscious conduct of life?The lecture will explore the concept of personal hauntings. The role of the unconscious in the conduct of daily life will be examined. The significance of “complex” theory as a useful tool for self-examination and psychotherapy will be presented and means of identifying complexes through dream work and pattern analysis discussed. We will work towards enlarging participants’ sense of the many arenas in which energies and concomitant messages from the past direct and contaminate present choices.James Hollis, PhD, is a Jungian analyst, Executive Director of the Jung Society of Washington, and a co-founder of the Philadelphia Jung Institute.  He has written 14 books which are translated into 19 foreign languages.  He is a retired Professor of Humanitites, and presently a Professor of Jungian Psychology for Saybrook Graduate School of San Francisco.

Even when we don't FEEL grateful, we can still practice. Gratitude not only has a positive ripple effect on our physical, emotional, and mental health, it makes us more resilient, joyful, and creative.  It transforms what we have into enough.More than enough.Simply put, gratitude rocks! At this workshop, you will create and take home a gratitude kit + a plan to put it into action + a whole pile of inspiration! You will tap into your creative spirit and together we will make magic.This kit will create a whole-hearted ripple of love throughout your life, and those around you.Cost: $45 (price includes all supplies and HST).If you would like to avoid the Eventbrite fee, I will happily accept email money transfers to kateUdurie@gmail.com.Please note: Once registered, refunds are not available.Love from a past workshop: http://nicole-belanger.com/2014/02/12/a-small-town-trip-with-big-time-gratitude/ (by Nicole Belanger)\"Life is not a straight line. Speed bumps, setbacks, ups and downs. Big ups. Big downs. Big wins. Big losses. And so so many in betweens. Life comes with a whole pile of hopes, assumptions, expectations and beliefs. How life \"should\" go. But as you and I both know, sometimes life doesn't go as planned. We get stuck. We get lost. We get hurt.The remedy? Gratitude. And gratitude ... is a PRACTICE.Gratitude has the ability to pull us into the now. To pause. It has magnetic energy that grows and expands and attracts possibility to everything it touches. When we focus on what and who we are grateful for, transformation follows. You will be changed. You will spread change. It’s a practice and it takes practice. It's not about waiting for things to happen, to be perfect, to be extraordinary - it is your gratitude practice that will shift the way you see the ordinary, the every day. Your gratitude kit will give you the skills, tools, ideas, and momentum to keep your gratitude practice going throughout the entire year…and beyond.When we embody, express, and spread gratitude our heart feels lighter, brighter, and whole. Gratitude changes our perspective. Gratitude strengthens our work and our relationships – with those we love, and with our SELF – because gratitude gives as much to the sender as the receiver.\"- Kate",

Atop this steaming heap, one '70s space miracle stands a hair head and shoulders above its spiritual brothers and sisters, broadcast only once on North American soil. We can't tell you the name of it. But, like, guess.Join the crew of local YouTube channel This Exists in celebrating the season with a secret screening of the best worst holiday special of all time, and come early for a curated pre-show featuring the crème de la crème of festive garbage.

        "description": "\n\n\n\nLadies &amp; Gentlemen, join us for a Gentlemen's Edition Cocktail Evening with Standard Spirit Distillery at East Village favorite, Mash &amp; Grape! We're thrilled to be partnering up with both a gem of a wine &amp; spirits shop, and a local distillery, known for their unique and tasty whiskey-like oak &amp; rye wormwood craft absinthe:\n\n\"Distilled from a high rye thin mash with local NY grains and wormwood before being stave aged in American and French oak. Different from a typical absinthe, we distill and age our wormwood rye  to drink straight like a whiskey. With notes of rye spiciness and smoky oak- no water and no sugar is needed, and no anise or licorice is used. \"\n\nAnd heart cut moonshine:\n\n\"Distilled from a high rye thin mash with local NY rye and corn in small batches at our Brooklyn distillery. Fermenting on the grain and then distilling with fresh grains suspended in the column make for a unique buttery corn and spicy rye taste that distinguishes our moonshine to rival any whiskey. Bottling only a very selective Heart Cut portion brings you face-to-face with the complex grain flavor, broad body, and smooth taste. No swill!\"\n\nWe'll be doing a guided tasting of both spirits, as well as cocktails showcasing the best of the spirits. We will also have cheese &amp; charcuterie &amp; small bites.\n\nDate: Tuesday, July 26, 2016\n\nTime: 6:30-8:30 PM (and onward)\n\nLocation: Mash &amp; Grape, 24 Avenue C, New York\n\nTickets: $18, includes guided tasting of two spirits, two cocktails, light bites; cocktail specials will be available at a cash bar next door\n\nAfter the tasting,  we'll take the cocktail party next door for cocktail specials at Sanatorium, a hospital-themed bar by the creators of Apoteke.\n\nWe hope you can make it, and feel free to invite your lady &amp; gentleman friends!\n\nRSVP soon, as space is limited. \n\nJoin here to receive invitations to Women Who Whiskey events.\n",
