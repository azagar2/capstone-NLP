Do you really need to go through first dates and new lovers all over again? Or is this happening to everybody: sexy confident adults who can have amazing relationships and not be trying to get married and start a family? Cougar town? Utopia? Or just a lot of wine and lingerie? Who are these guys you're dating? A new kind of fun!\n\nAudience Quotes:\n\nExcellent show. Several days later and we're still laughing and imitating Kendra! - J. M.\n\nSuch a great night out! Anne Marie, you rocked it with your incredibly honest, hilarious and poignant take on life after marriage.

In an interview he explained that \"the group's main philosophy was that things should somehow be driven on the edge\u2014on that edge when you cannot really recognize what's serious, what's not serious; you know, what's true, what's not true; what's sort of from life and what is a sheer imagination. Simply that edge\u2014because we thought that on that edge real things happen.\u201d This concert brings together six extremely different\u2014wonderfully different\u2014pieces of music.

One of the most popular among the fermented beverages, kombucha is a sugar-sweetened tea fermented by a culture of living organisms called a SCOBY (symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast.) This tonic is akin to raw vinegar.\n\nRaw vinegar is used to aid detoxification, to add as a sour flavor in foods, for cleaning and much more. It alkalizes our bodies and can be used as a remedy for a wide array of ailments or conditions. An acetic acid ferment, raw vinegar is simple to make. Yet commercially, it is almost always deprived of its live culture benefits.\n\nWe will learn about home brewing kombucha for beginners, plus dive into the art of second fermentation, techniques and methods to get your brew at its best. We will also learn how to make raw apple cider vinegar, which requires nothing more than apples and pure water. Live kombucha cultures will be available for you to take home, plus home brewing instructions to get your first batch going. Participants will also be able to taste all of our fermented food and beverages, all made locally. Space is limited, so be sure to sign up by February 13, 2017.\n",

During the past decade, the duo traveled many countries in Europe and made several tours in the United States. The band takes a new creative direction tinted with hip-hop and more generally hybrid electronic music after the release of their fourth album \"Addiction\" in 2014.\n\nThey decided to break the fetters that connected them almost exclusively to \"Dubstep\" and started using other forms of expression. It is therefore with their new album \"Hybrid Distillery\" that the group now has to make an impression by imposing its style in other genres of electronic music. This fifth album is not only another acoustic chapter, it is also about graphics. The draftsman/graffiti artist/director \"Ebola - Delit2fuite\" brings a whole new visual world mixed with, just like Ganja White Night, artistic originality and singularity never achieved until now.\n\n*Suport*\n\nBoogie T.\n\nMore info TBA\n",

        "description": "This March, Women Who Whiskey is turning six! As a way to support women (who make this group possible), and as a thank you for sticking with us for over half a decade, we are making our birthday celebration all about International Women's Day! Every March, the world gets together to celebrate and empower women; this year, we want to join in, and we want you to join us!\n\nOn Saturday, March 11 from 1-3 PM, join us for a celebration of International Women's Day and Women Who Whiskey's birthday with a special event to benefit the girls &amp; women of New York City. Event proceeds and donations will support The Bowery Mission recovery programs for women and Big Brothers Big Sisters NYC's girls' programs.\n\n     Date: Saturday, March 11, 2017\n\n     Time: 1-3 PM\n\n     Location: Tanner Smith's, 204 West 55th St, NY 10019 (between Broadway &amp; 7th Ave)\n\nTickets: $35, includes Woodford Reserve tasting, 2 Woodford Reserve cocktails, light bites, sweet treats, photo booth, live music, make up bar, oxygen bar, personalized haikus, raffle prizes and a costume contest, cocktail specials, and more! Ticket proceeds will go to support The Bowery Mission and Big Brothers Big Sisters NYC, our partner organizations for this event.\n\nIn addition to all the fun activities and booths we'll have for you, we'll also have some raffles and contests where you can win Woodford Reserve cocktail kits, hand-crafted hats, and more! Details below!\n\nThis event is open to ladies and gentlemen, so bring your family, friends &amp; lovers!\n\nCostume Contest\n\nTo honor the great women of the past - including whiskey women! - who fought for the world we live in today, we invite you to come dressed up as your favorite historical bad ass women. It could be anyone from Rosie the Riveter to Norma Ray, fighting for labor rights; from Dorothy Parker to Zelda Fitzgerald, wielding their wit and their writing; from Rosa Parks to Coretta Scott King, fighting for racial justice; from Eleanor Roosevelt to Jackie Kennedy, using the White House as a national podium. Your imagination is the only limitation! We invite you to be creative and sassy! Three winners will receive a handmade custom cloche hat from Christina's Millinery.\n\nDonation Raffle\n\nIn addition to donating proceeds from the event to our partner organizations, we'll also be collecting donation items on their behalf! For Big Brothers Big Sister, please bring new, unused/unopened school supply items, such as pens, pencils, notebooks, backpacks, etc. In 2016, NYC became the first city in the US to provide free hygienic products to girls and women in schools and shelters, but they still have a lot of other needs that we can help with! For the Bowery Mission, we'll be collecting new, unused/unopened travel-sized toiletries such as soap, deodorant, shaving cream, toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo/conditioner, etc. Every donation item will receive a raffle ticket, so the more you bring, the better your odds! If you can't bring a donation item, but still want to support these organizations, we are offering the option to purchase tickets that include general admission plus a $10 donation to the organization of your choice. If you purchase one of these tickets, you will receive one raffle ticket and be eligible to win a prize, as if you had brought a donation item. Three winners will receive a Woodford Reserve Cocktail Kit, including a mini bottle of Woodford Reserve, Vermouth, Bitters, a mug, and Cocktail Kingdom barware.\n\nWe are so excited about this special event, and hope you can join us to help support the girls &amp; women in our community! The space is large, so feel free to invite all family, friends &amp; lovers!\n\nLadies &amp; Gentlemen Welcome!\n",

        "description": "A free course showing how process integration techniques and NRCan's INTEGRATION software can be used to identify energy efficiency opportunities in complex industrial plants.\n\nProcess integration analyzes the energy use of a plant or process as a whole, rather than solely considering each equipment item or energy system independently. As such, it can determine the thermodynamically minimum consumption of hot and cold utilities necessary for the plant, and provide insight into design or retrofit options that may attain these targets. Energy savings ranging from 10 to 30% are typical, even in up-to-date plants that have been subject to conventional energy audit methods, resulting in cost savings, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water savings, and increased production throughput.\n\nINTEGRATION software, an easy-to-use but powerful tool available for free from NRCan, assists in the application of process integration techniques to complex industrial plants with high heat requirements. INTEGRATION also includes modules for quickly evaluating heat recovery opportunities for boilers, refrigeration systems, and compression systems.\n\nDuration: approximately 3.5 hours\n\nParticipants will be given an evaluation version of the INTEGRATION software that they can install on a laptop for use during the course.\n\nFor other free introductory courses, see http://www.rerinfo.ca/RETScreenTraining.html\n",
