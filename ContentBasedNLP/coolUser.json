        "description": "I am please to announce our Third Annual Hello City Group Show opens on March 6th, 2015, with the opening reception on Friday the 6th from 6-10pm, and will be on view for the weekend only—closing on Monday, March 9th. The Blue Oak Brewing Company will be here opening night serving up some locally crafted brews for us to enjoy. Kitty White, better known as Hello Kitty, was first introduced in Japan in 1974 and in the United States in 1976. Since then, this character—who if you didn't know is a girl from Britain who enjoys baking, traveling and listening to music— has become an iconic image recognized worldwide. For this show, we have asked local artists to reimagine Sanrio's Kitty White in any artistic form they choose. You can expect to see a wide range of techniques and mediums used from this year's group; all of which place their own individual stamp on this time honored character.Featuring Artwork by:Mark Adamusik  NORIO FUJIKAWAZEBULON GOODELL  Krista WrightElliott C.
