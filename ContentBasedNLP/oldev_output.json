This survey offers a rare opportunity to discover another side of Young’s creative genius, both behind and in front of the camera.The series of rarely seen films includes:Human Highway: Director’s Cut (1982/2014 - digitally restored),  a wildly anarchic satire of Cold War America starring Young, Dean Stockwell, Sally Kirkland, Russ Tamblyn, and Devo. (Thursday July 23, 7:00PM)Journey Through the Past (1974), a road movie and surrealistic fantasy with Young and his musical contemporaries. (Friday July 24, 7:00PM)Rust Never Sleeps (1979), a concept ‘theatrical’ performance with Young’s band Crazy Horse. (Saturday July 25, 4:30PM)Muddy Track (1987 – digitally restored), a one-of-a-kind chronicle of a troubled European tour with Young’s band Crazy Horse.

(Sunday July 26, 4:30PM)A Day at the Gallery (2012), the paintings of Shepard Fairey come to life to tell a story of their own. Solo Trans (1984), Hal Ashby finds Young at an interesting artistic crossroad, illustrated by an opening solo acoustic set that moves into a song cycle of his experimental and electronic Trans period, followed by a closing set of rockabilly music accompanied by Young’s band The Shocking Pinks.

It was the beginning of a twenty year journey for Geil and the 4-piece ensemble.\n\nDanny B. Harvey\n\nDANNY B. HARVEY was born in Killeen, Texas and at the age of 6 moved to Catlettsburg, KY. where he first picked up and started playing the guitar. At the age of 15 after moving to Canyon Country, CA. he was fortunate enough to receive his first formal lessons with the great JOE PASS. Up until then he had learned to play by only watching older country guitarists back in Ashland, KY and Huntington WV, falling in love with the guitar style of fellow Kentuckian MERLE TRAVIS. At seventeen he was accepted to USC on a full scholarship to study classical guitar with PEPE ROMERO. Feeling out of place (after all he had only moved away for rural KY. two years earlier) and anxious to make a name for himself he moved to England with LEVI DEXTER after only years of study. Danny soon developed a finger picking guitar style that is very unique and based on his idol MERLE TRAVIS, CHET ATKINS, JOE PASS and his classical-technic he learned at USC.As a guitarist, producer and composer Danny has played and recorded with such great artists as Levi Dexter, Tim Polecat, Johnny Ramone, Nancy Sinatra, Lemmy Kilmister, Lee Rocker, Slim Jim Phantom and Wanda JacksonAnnie Marie Lewis\n\nAnnie Marie Lewis, American singer, Linda Gail Lewis' daughter and Jerry Lee Lewis' niece\n\n\n\nTickets available include:\n\nGeneral Admission\n\nBalcony VIP Tables (4 seats)\n\nBalcony VIP Bartop\n\nPlease Note: We will have a dancefloor in front of the stage for this event.\n",

        "description": "The year is 1991, the universe is not our own, but rather a high-technology utopia wherein humanity stretches across multiple star-systems, and manages an addiction to cream-based foodstuffs and perpetual body-modification. Following an altogether alien holiday celebration, three bros (Zak Tatham, Aaron Mancyzk and Efehan Elbi) witness a commercial for an intergalactic mall known as the biosphere, and, with the help of Zak’s sister Tima, hijack a spaceship in an effort to fulfill the libidinal desires promised by the advertisement. The resulting adventure is an anarchic comedy that pays tribute to JOHN CARPENTER’S DARK STAR and Tarkovsky’s SOLARIS, but with a hyperactive energy akin to the work of Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, and a transgressive edge reminiscent of John Waters.\n\nSprung from the minds behind the hilarious Toronto underground web-series LIVING WITH FRIENDS, SPACE BREAKERS is sure to confound, baffle and even shock most audiences. However, those willing to join the film’s joyously demented wavelength will find themselves breaking into uncontrollable hysterics throughout as Zak, Aaron and Efehan squabble with stowaways, Tima transmogrifies into a tattoo-ridden bro, and the whole gang struggles to fight off a literal swarm of space dicks attempting to penetrate the ship. It only gets weirder from there. (Peter Kuplowsky)\n\nSingle Tickets are $10 OR see all three days of programming with an All-Access Pass for only $30: https://www.universe.com/wtf2016\n",

        "description": "The Future of Comedy Show presents Dave Landau. Seen on NBC’s Last Comic Standing, Comedy Central’s Live At Gotham, and heard nationwide as a regular guest on The Bob &amp; Tom Radio Show.Featuring Saginaw's very own Mike BallW Special guest Host Tom E Thompson Sponsored by Stretch Limo! About Dave LandauWorking the road nonstop since his 21st birthday, Dave Landau has grown into a true comedic juggernaut. Finding himself much in-demand among audiences and club owners due to his deadpan demeanor and those jokes — my God, those jokes — that fluidly fly forth with breakneck pacing and perfect timing. Dave, it can be said with all due respect, is a throwback to another era of comedy. The entertaining everyman. Innocent enough at first blush; as he states his case, you begin to see where you and he have quite a bit in common. A wife, a house. An odd sense of calm in an increasingly crazy world. You’re on a tour of the familiar and prosaic, with Dave Landau as the bus driver.Then he drops his foot on the accelerator. And things start to get wild. You see, Dave Landau might appear to be just like you, but he’s not really. His mind goes to places that angels would fear to tread, and he has no problem telling you about it. The mark of a great comedian, it is said, is the ability to find jokes where others would find tears. Dave find jokes everywhere; with his own foibles and faults, to his family, to pop culture and the state of the world today.Cutting his comedic teeth as a teenager in Detroit in the Second City’s Conservatory, Dave Landau has risen to become one of the most in-demand headliners working today. He’s appeared on Comedy Central’s “Live At Gotham” as well as being featured prominently on two consecutive seasons of NBC’s “Last Comic Standing.” He’s become a regular on the nationally-syndicated “Bob &amp; Tom” radio show, and was honored as one of the top 21 club comics of today at HBO’s Las Vegas Comedy Festival.",

        "description": "Taking place in an alternate timeline, the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago safely passes over Earth. Years later, two dinosaurs named Henry and Ida who are farmers give birth to three children, Libby, Buck and Arlo. Although Libby and Buck easily adjust to the farming lifestyle, Arlo finds that he is too timid to work in such an environment. Henry decides that in order to give Arlo a sense of purpose, he puts him in charge of guarding their silo from pests and helps them set up a trap. While on guard, Arlo catches a feral cave boy, and is too reluctant to kill him so he sets him free.This extraordinarily charming film has been receiving shining reviews from critics and audiences due to it’s endearing characters and beautifully animated landscape. We are so thrilled to welcome this clever and adorable film to our big screen, but we’re definitely gearing up to bring a few Kleenex along with us. ",

You are going to love these two!Jaspar Lepak (pronounced JAS-per LEE-pack) ﷯is a folk/Americana songstress whose  remarkable gift for melody is only surpassed by her poetry. A child of the Sonoran Desert, her songs are deeply influenced by the many places she has called home: Tucson, Minneapolis, Durban (South Africa), and currently Seattle.

The aim is for everyone to enjoy dinner together; all items will be vegan and gluten-free with at least one meat item (which will also be gluten-free). Dinners are 19+.{About Chef Daniel Holloway}Executive Chef Daniel Holloway of Urban Acorn Catering believes great food is achieved by harnessing bold flavours from humble ingredients. With over 15 years in the culinary industry, he has catered for high profiled clients such as Margaret Atwood, Prince, former Lieutenant Governor Michaëlle Jean and Vegan athlete turned deputy general for the green part of Canada, George Laraque. Chef Holloway’s signature style can be best described as refined comfort food, a blend of rustic Canadian cuisine with fine French techniques. After studying Culinary Management at Humber College, Holloway began a four year apprenticeship under Chef Tobias Pohl-Weary former owner and head chef of Red Canoe Bistro in Burlington. He became a sous chef, later a pastry chef, then branched out on his own to launch a private chef business in the Halton/Peel region.  Looking to bridge the social gap between vegans and omnivores, Holloway moved to Toronto in 2012 and joined forces with Haitian partner Marie Fitrion. They created Urban Acorn LTD., a Toronto-based sustainable plant-based food company focused on connecting food and community. By collaborating with other chefs and like-minded local businesses, Holloway aims to create a communal connection to food and celebrate its diversity regardless of dietary restrictions. His food philosophy is simple…Food Should Unite, Not Divide People. ",

The thing is, someone replies. And they sound serious. Fearful of what she might have done, Harper runs to Ray’s apartment in the middle of the night to warn him. At first Ray takes the situation lightly; it’s just some nut job online messing with her. But as the night goes on and a mysterious white van stalks Ray’s apartment, suddenly everything becomes more real. As they try to stay calm and deal with this bizarre situation like regular people, they’re forced to confront the downfall of their relationship and figure out where it all went wrong before the hitman takes away any chance of them getting back together.",

Johnson, the loveable and dim adopted son of a poor black sharecropper family. Johnson decides to go out on his own to discover his true identity and make his way in the world, but comes across several ridiculous and hilarious hurdles along the way in this classic rags-to-riches story. After THE JERK released and Steve Martin first hit the silver screen in this powerfully hilarious debut, critics had no problem reminding audiences that he was the \"arrow-in-the-head-guy\" from Saturday Night Live, but, it quickly became apparent that his comedic genius translated to any screen, stage, or platform he happened to be on. Now often considered to be one of the funniest movies of all time, this movie is a striking balance of intelligent wit and outright oddball stupidity, and we can't wait to watch it again with you! Thanks to JFL42, this screening will be preceded by a side-splitting stand-up act by K Trevor Wilson, self described as the Man-Mountain of Comedy and hosted by the very funny Amanda Brooke Perrin.

        "title": "Robots vs. Unicorns: CONAN THE BARBARIAN",
        "description": "In 1968, a tirelessly ambitious Austrian bodybuilder arrived in America. Despite a thick accent and all-but-unpronounceable name, the sheer force of Arnold Schwarzenegger's personality proved even bigger than his biceps. The five-time Mr. Universe winner set his sights on Hollywood early. Despite an inauspicious debut (as \"Arnold Strong\") in 1970's HERCULES IN NEW YORK, a memorable supporting role in Bob Rafelson's STAY HUNGRY (1976) garnered him a Golden Globe, while the 1977 bodybuilding documentary PUMPING IRON proved a perfect showcase for his charisma. Arnold's star was on the rise, but true stardom eluded him. Ironically constrained by the same things that made him memorable (no one was going to cast him as a romantic lead), he needed a role that would play to his strengths... literally.It took almost half a century for Robert E. Howard's Conan of Cimmeria to emerge from the pulp pages of WEIRD TALES and onto movie screens. Though the character had enjoyed a successful revival in the pages of Marvel Comics, finding an actor who could embody those larger-than-life qualities on screen had thus far proved impossible. In Schwarzenegger, producer Edward R. Pressman found Conan's ideal real-world avatar. And in Conan, Schwarzenegger found his passport into the studio big league.Director (and Hollywood enfant terrible) John Milius and co-writer Oliver Stone set aside most of the overtly fantastical elements of Howard's original stories. Their Nietzsche-fueled revenge plot provided a steely-but-simple narrative spine to Conan's journey from slave to thief to warrior to king. But the film also echoes Milius' APOCALYPSE NOW screenplay, with James Earl Jones' messianic cult leader Thulsa Doom as a Hyborean Age Colonel Kurtz awaiting Conan at the end of his own river of blood. Though only a minor financial success upon release in 1981, CONAN THE BARBARIAN sparked a small but energetic wave of lower-budgeted fantasy films. Most were forgettable, but a few, including Don Coscarelli's THE BEASTMASTER and Albert Pyun's THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, would spawn cult followings of their own. More importantly, CONAN THE BARBARIAN soon set Schwarzenegger on his improbable, inevitable path from \"unpronounceable name\" to \"household name\". ",

For whatever reason, the Tiki phenomenon kind of stopped dead in its tracks sometime during the 70s. Sad but true. Since then, it’s been living in the past, spinning its wheels, asleep in the cabana, and churning out the same-old same-old. And while Tiki “same-old same -old” is more exciting than most, the potential to push it into an even bolder and more over-the-top direction is limitless.\n\nThe Coconut Club is not a restaurant, but rather a supper club experience.

        "description": "23rd Chicago Underground Film Festival Opening Night!Wednesday, June 18:00pmTony Conrad: Completely In PresentLacrimal GrooveMV Carbon4 min., video, 2015, USA“An isolated human calls upon the insects to interpret a message sent through the circuitry of a Buchla.  Communication gaps are patched between the species as the frequencies surpass the limitations of language.” MCTony Conrad: Completely In PresentTyler Hubby98 min., video, 2016, USA World PremiereThe Chicago Underground Film Festival is proud to present the World Premiere of Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present, a two-decades-in-the-making documentary about the legendary artist’s extraordinary life and influential work. One of the great American artists of our era, Conrad’s work has remained largely unknown to the world at large. Conrad’s career has directly touched and influenced most major contemporary movements in art, film, and music since the early 1960s, pushing the boundaries of what moving images and sound can be and providing inspiration for artists and musicians everywhere. Conrad performed in Jack Smith’s legendary underground film Flaming Creatures, for which he also provided the soundtrack. His own work with film commenced audaciously in 1966 with The Flicker, a film composed entirely of black and white frames, which turned the firm world on its head and helped launch the movement of “structural filmmaking” that dominated experimental film for the next decade. Working with composers such as Stockhausen and La Monte Young he was a central figure in the development of Just Intonation and Minimalism which led to his subsequent role in the formation of the Velvet Underground, directly or indirectly influencing all guitar-based rock music that followed. Conrad was an early proponent of public access television as a democratic activist tool. He continued to perform and make groundbreaking works right up until his death in April of this year and had finally begun to achieve the recognition he deserved.Reflecting Conrad’s own unconventional and forward-thinking means of creating art, Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present mixes intimate footage of the artist and his collaborators and accomplices shot by Hubby over the past two decades, along with selections from Conrad’s personal archive of recordings and films. Using a nonlinear framework that blends unconventional narration, deafening drones, Pythagorean mathematics, flickering frames of white and black, and of course the always surprising and playful Tony Conrad himself guiding viewers through free associative narratives of his astounding and creative life.“Tony Conrad has slowly been emerging from avant-gardist obscurity over the past few years, and about time. His multifold career — as experimental film and video-maker, composer, musician and sound artist — still looks radical and prescient a half-century after it began” – The New York TimesIncludes admission to festival opening night party at Elastic Arts with performances from Ben Baker Billington, Bruce McClure and Tony Conrad's Drone Strings--\"A pioneering force behind the evolution of minimalism, violinist and composer TONY CONRAD introduced the idea of “Eternal Music,” a droning, mesmerizing performance idiom that employed long durations, amplification, and precise pitch to explore new worlds of sound. Through both his solo work and through collaborations with artists including LaMonte Young, John Cale, and Faust, he forged new creative directions that proved enormously influential on successive generations of artists ranging in background from pop to the avant-garde.\" - Big Ears Film FestivalIn commemoration of Tony Conrad and his work, JIM BECKER (Violin), MV CARBON (Cello), and FRED LONBERG-HOLM (Cello) will perform Tony Conrad's Amplified Drone Strings.--BRUCE MCCLURE is an experimental filmmaker, performance artist and architect. The Brooklyn-based McClure makes films and performances in which 16mm film projectors play the leading role. With his idiosyncratic methods of projecting, McClure may call himself a worthy successor of radical avant-gardists such as Peter Kubelka, Ken Jacobs en Hollis Frampton.\"Bruce McClure is an artist both increasingly known and unknown. His film performances have been featured (and cultishly coveted) in film festivals, galleries, cinematheques, and in various screening programs throughout the US, and in cities such as Rotterdam and Toronto. His name has become, in recent years, common currency in avant-garde circles, yet it takes time and effort to get to know his work, literally and conceptually. You must travel to see it, or if you’re lucky, it has to come to “a theatre near you...McClure has been called a para-cinema artist, a proto-cinema artist, an expanded-cinema artist, and even a vaudevillian.\" - Cinema Scope--BEN BAKER BILLINGTON will perform free form jazz with a Chicago-based ensemble. Billington has been an extremely active part of the Chicago music community since 2004 while also steadily touring the country with various projects. Primarily a percussionist, Billington is most often found in improvisational ensembles that lean into free jazz, noise, and psychedelic rock stylings. Current projects include Tiger Hatchery, ADT, ONO, Partner, Banal Anml, and countless more throughout the years. Ben also composes solo electronic music under the name Quicksails. Billington has brought together a special group of musicians tonight that will work within the realms of Tony Conrad's sound sphere by utilizing free improvisation, minimalist approaches to melody, and raw emotions.",

The band has developed an excellent reputation for the way they mix soul, rock and gospel elements into a truly compelling and unique sound. They have a brand new record coming out, and a tour coming up, and they wanted to play their new material for a hometown audience before hitting the road. So, I promise you, this is going to be a fun evening you won't forget! Show starts at 8 pm. Tickets are $15 in advance and $20 at the door.Speaking of Oakland, the very talented folk and blues chanteuse Aireene Espirtu will open the show with her beautiful voice and distinctive bluesy folk songs.The venue is Point Richmond Acoustic, 201 Martina Avenue, Point Richmond 94801. And although our venue usually presents mostly acoustic music, Saturday's show will not be acoustic.Oh by the way, since we're hosted by our friends at the First Methodist Church, please no alchoholic beverages at the show.",

        "description": "In this very special event curated exclusively for Indigo Blue’s Academy of Burlesque, spend the night with Dr. Lucky in this salon-style lecture/demonstration about the history of American burlesque history and discussion about the multiple possibilities of its future.  Inspired by the exciting growth of burlesque in style and content around the globe, this evening will be a history lesson and a call to action to bring into being the burlesque world we want to live in.Dr. Lucky will trace the history of burlesque as a literary form and a performance trope.  Coined in the 16th century as a literary form that inverts form and content, burlesque is a subset of parody that either elevates the mundane or vulgarizes the lofty.  When Lydia Thompson and the British Blondes invaded the United States in 1868, the public understanding of burlesque transformed from a literary form to a performance style, and the worlds of “leg shows” and burlesque became intertwined in the public imagination.  This history is well known, but we will pay particular attention to the “breeding ground” that existed prior to Thompson and her Blondes “coming on the scene,” so to speak, by examining other popular amusement and theatrical traditions of the time, and unpacking their relationship to burlesque.  This lecture will cover the influence of cultural forms such as blackface minstrel shows, feminized spectacles, antebellum theatre, vaudeville, concert saloons, and dime museums, to contextualize the reception around and popularization of burlesque in America.We will use this lecture and the metaphor of a “breeding ground” to think through the convergence of ideas, events, and social trends that made neo-burlesque popular today.  In small “break out groups,” we will collaboratively discuss the future of burlesque, and literally “map out” plans for the future as a way to chart infinite possibilities.  The purpose is not to codify burlesque — and thereby imply through exclusion what’s “not” burlesque – but rather to have an open, honest, thoughtful discussion of what we imagine this world can be.",

He's racked up over 20 million views on YouTube, and had opened for many of rock bands he idolized growing up including: Godsmack, Korn, P.O.D., Sevendust, as well as Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe and Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche.The $20 tickets price for this concert is voluntary; you may pay more or less if you wish.  We do it this way because we never want price to be a barrier for anyone to come enjoy our music, and we also appreciate your support which empowers us to perform more concerts and make more music!  Just enter the amount you'd like to pay per ticket, and the number of tickets.",

Many employers in such fields as building maintenance, warehouse assembly, and security prefer to hire candidates already holding the OSHA 10 General certification.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour General Industry -- Designated Training Topics.This training program is intended to provide entry level general industry workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of general industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards.\n\nOSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nWalking and Working Surfaces, including fall protection -- 1 hourCovers trip hazards and considerations of different surfaces that employees may have to walk and work on.\n\nExit Routes, Emergency Action Plans, Fire Prevention Plans, and Fire Protection -- 1 hourCovers emergency evacuation procedures and routes.\n\nElectrical -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment\n\nHazard Communication -- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners and photocopier toner cartridges.\n\nElective - 2 hoursThe instructor will teach two to four of the following topics:\n\nHazardous MaterialsCovers safety considerations involving potentially harmful chemicals or objects.\n\nMaterials HandlingCovers diverse operations such as hoisting tons of steel with a crane, driving a truck loaded with concrete blocks, manually carrying bags and material, and stacking drums, barrels, kegs, lumber, or loose bricks.\n\nMachine GuardingCovers safety risks related to any moving parts of machines on premises. This topic is most common to industrial or MAKING work places which have such as a printing press or assembly line.\n\nIntroduction to Industrial HygieneIndustrial hygiene is the science of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling workplace conditions that may cause workers' injury or illness. Specifically, this topic covers considerations of ventilation and circulation of potentially hazardous fumes or vapors in the work place.\n\nBloodborne PathogensCovers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic microorganisms in the blood that could carry hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among other pathogens.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramCovers topics for consideration for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs\n\nFall ProtectionCovers ways to protect workers against fall hazards. This topic is particularly useful to industries with heightened fall dangers, such as stage actors or lighting technicians.\n\nOptional - 1 hourThere is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n",

But, if you’re getting sick of the standard go-to Carpenter choices (which are still amazing), then let us sway you to the equally fantastic Prince of Darkness. A priest (played by Donald Pleasance, a man who is forever welcome to our film screens) invites Professor Howard Birack and his students to explore an abandoned church where a strange vile of green liquid was found. The students decipher the text on the vile, where they discover that the liquid is meant to be the embodiment of Satan. When the liquid begins to give off streams of data to be further deciphered by the students, they learn more about its supposed evil implications, but when some of it leaks out and possesses members of the group, they quickly learn that it is a far more dangerous substance than they could have ever imagined.   Prince of Darkness will be screening as a part of our Halloween Spooktacular, and will be preceded by An American Werewolf in London and Halloween III: Season of the Witch.",

        "description": "Locked away from society in an apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Angulo brothers learn about the outside world through the films that they watch. Nicknamed the Wolfpack, the brothers spend their childhood re-enacting their favorite films using elaborate homemade props and costumes. With no friends and living on welfare, they feed their curiosity, creativity, and imagination with film, which allows them to escape from their feelings of isolation and loneliness. Everything changes when one of the brothers escapes, and the power dynamics in the house are transformed. The Wolfpack must learn how to integrate into society without disbanding the brotherhood.",

This electrifying revenge-thriller pits one man against the world around him as he sacrifices everything and everyone he loves to avenge his father’s murder.Young Hamlet’s world is turned upside down when, after the death of his father, his mother quickly marries Hamlet’s uncle Claudius. When the ghost of Hamlet’s father appears before him to accuse Claudius of murder, Hamlet is set upon a course of action which will have significant consequences for everyone that he holds dear. Hamlet is gripping tragedy fueled by grief and framed by a world dominated by the politics of fear.Both newcomers to Hamlet and Shakespeare aficionados will delight in this version; a perfect match for Driftwood’s inventive theatrical style and our magical outdoor settings.",

        "title": "Deviant Desires: Japanese Erotic Grotesque Horror",
        "description": "Lecturer: Jennifer LintonThe interwar years in Japan were a time of rapid modernization and social change. It was also a time of economic hardship and, as the fascists rose to power, increasingly repressive politics. During these difficult times, a popular cultural phenomena flourished. Dubbed by the Japanese media as “ero-guro-nansensu” (or, “erotic-grotesque-nonsense”), this movement rejected the narrow standards of conventional morality insisted upon by the fascists, and instead celebrated the deviant, the bizarre and the ridiculous. The stories of Edogawa Rampo, the first writer of the modern mystery in Japan, were wildly popular during these turbulent years. It is Rampo who best captured the darkly erotic and transgressive spirit of “ero-guro”, and his legacy has lasted until present day Japan.This lecture will focus on five films, three of which are adaptations of Rampo stories: Horrors of Malformed Men (1969), Teruo Ishii’s gloriously schlocky, psychedelic mashup of Rampo-with-butoh, Blind Beast (1969), Yasuzô Masumura’s lurid tale of sexual obsession and sadomasochism, and Koji Wakamatsu’s strongly anti-nationalist Caterpillar (2010). Other films to be discussed will include Nagisa Oshima’s infamous art film In The Realm of the Senses (1976) — described by film critic Ian Buruma as “perhaps the only intelligent hardcore porno film ever made” — and the seldom seen, and equally controversial, anime film Midori – the Girl in the Freak Show (1992).",

        "description": "Third film in Bright Nights: the 5th Annual Baltic-Nordic Film Festival dir. Hynek Pallas, Jane MagnussonSweden, 2013, 107 minutes Swedish (and various other languages) with English sub-titles  With a winning mixture awe and irreverence, TRESPASSING BERGMAN informatively and entertainingly explores the home, life, films and legacy of legendary auteur Ingmar Bergman with the help of other world-cinema legends. Filmmakers such as Michael Haneke, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Lars von Trier, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Claire Denis, Wes Craven, Robert De Niro, Ang Lee and others discuss the impact that Bergman’s films had on their lives and careers. Filmmakers (and noted Swedish film critics) Magnusson and Pallas combine previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage from the making of Bergman’s films, well-chosen clips, and a career chronology with candid conversations with other filmmakers, some shot at Bergman’s Faro Island home and others at locations around the world. A playful tone is established early on as the interviewees arrive at Faro — some on foot, others in luxury cars and some by helicopter, to the accompaniment of a Philip Glass-like score. To be in the master’s home inspires Inarritu to observe, ”If cinema was a religion, this would be Mecca, the Vatican. This is the centre of it all.” A must-see for film lovers. ",

Based on the novel \"Lemon\" (McSweeney's, 2001), here is a comical-lyrical exploration of jerry-rigged sanity in the spirit of Ashby and Gogol, featuring a cast of curious dozens from the New York stage and street.USARunning Time: 96Director(s): Lawrence KrauserScreenwriter(s): Lawrence KrauserProducer(s): Josh WickCast: Todd d'Amour, Rebecca Hart, Jay Smith, Lia Aprile, Paul Willis, April MatthisProgrammer's Notes:Life has become a little sour for Wendell, a recently re-bachelored oddball of brawny nervousness. His ex-girlfriend Marge has just left him with a letter full of spelling mistakes, and he spends his days surrounded by cubicle-mates that coddle and hover over him. One day, he stumbles upon a lemon waiting for him on the street – an ordinary lemon that unravels his world while also providing a newfangled sweetness. Novelist-turned-director Lawrence Krauser and his painter-editor wife Larissa Tokmakova have created a truly unique “citrussexy” romance that is discombobulating, overwhelming, and an offbeat critique about modern day companionship. - Marie Jamora, ProgrammerPlaying with short film:Que La Nuit Soit Douce8-year old Alice and her brother, the 5-year old Lucas accompany their parents to visit their beloved grandfather in the hospital where he is to be dying.

Yet it's about more than just one family’s struggle to keep their land out of foreclosure. The film explores the roles history and ancestry play in our present-day lives, asking: what happens when the cost of preserving family heritage is the family itself?USARunning Time: 80World PremiereDirector(s): Morgan Schmidt-FengProducer(s): Morgan Schmidt-FengCast: Nancy Prebilich, Anthony Prebilich, Barbara Prebilich, Cindy Holland, John Holland, Samantha Holland, Nicholas Holland, Alex HollandProgrammer's Notes: The Great Recession did not just hit Wall St. and Main St. It hit the few remaining family farms in the nation. While documenting the everyday difficulties of maintaining an independent local farm, Director Morgan Schmidt-Feng brings us an intimate story that is about more than just one family struggling to keep their land out of foreclosure. The story asks what it means to give up everything for your history, your heritage, and your identity. It asks what it means to be part of a family, to care for the Earth and its inhabitants. On Her Own is a powerful story of life, death, and the precious connection we hold with the natural world. - Michael Mahaffie, ProgrammerPlaying with short film:MujerThree Latinas of different generations take pleasure in helping each other bathe, dress up, and cook dinner.USARunning Time: 10 Director(s): Sofia CanalesProducer(s): Sofia CanalesCast: Rosa Emma Estrada, Rosa Emma Canales, Emily Judith Canales",

        "description": "Originally a blacksmith’s workshop, the renovated office building at 216 Pretoria Avenue stands as a testament to conservation, sustainable design, and excellence in timber construction. Wood was used throughout the design for conservation, structural, and aesthetic purposes.\n\nThe design for the new office space takes advantage of the existing structure; most of the existing wood framing was retained, as well as the original built-up wood slab floor from the blacksmith’s workshop, forming part of the ceiling in the lower level. The “warehouse floor” wood slab was preserved and repaired by infilling openings using custom milled white pine lumber, installed to match the existing in place. The new and old components of the floor are connected together using the traditional techniques used for the original floor construction. The roof over the main floor could not be retained due to structural issues and a poor building envelope. The cross-laminated timber panel roof deck is a contemporary version of the existing wood slab floor below and pay homage to the heritage of the building. The CLT roofing system was prefabricated and assembled on site in less than a day. The redesign of the office space recreates the honest industrial forms and heavy timber from the original blacksmith workshop.\n\nGlue-laminated beams and Douglas fir columns form the core structural system, in combination with the existing wood perimeter framing. The key structural details seen throughout the office are the connections between the beams and columns, assembled using custom steel bases, flanges and bolts. One of the most innovative structural feats of the building is the three-storey CLT entry tower, complete with a suspended steel stair structure. The two elements form a powerful symbiotic relationship; the CLT walls provide the supporting structure for the main stair while the stair itself provides lateral shear resistance.\n\nUsing exposed wood also fulfilled the required fire-ratings for structural, wall, and floor elements; given the non-typical construction, calculations were prepared for building officials using data from the Canadian Wood Council and manufacturers to demonstrate compliance.\n\nAesthetically, wood’s warmth, lightweight appearance, and natural elegance play an important role in the building. Solid maple and birch and veneered plywood were chosen as the primary materials for cabinetry, millwork, doors, interior window sills and baseboards. The combination of wood elements with soft cream colored walls provides warmth and effectively tempers and reflects light to create an open, natural atelier space.\n",

They felt it was their job to create a brand of swimwear catered to all women; body types and styles while fighting the social stigma of what is considered an attractive woman. It all began while shopping for swimwear one evening with a group of friends. While there were swim-lines for thin women and plus size women, what about all the women in between?  After hours of searching for the perfect swim suit, they were left pointing out their insecurities rather than their beauty. Here at swim by lee, all of societies “imperfections” will be displayed and glorified with confidence.

As Chad B puts it “Focus is the new IQ and nothing will distract me from my goals!”\n\n2015 proved to be a great year for the Newark NJ native signing with Indie Label Global Empire Music Group, literally shut down Hot97’s “Who’s Next” show at the historic NYC SOBS’s and a memorable SXSW 2015 All Hip Hop performance. Chad B also toured with DipSet and Freakey Zeekey performing summer smash “We Hustle” ft. Lil Wayne across the country with European dates in Dubai, Germany, and Amsterdam. Chad B is and has been arguably one of the hardest working acts in the Music Industry.\n\nThe talented 28 year old was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey to a single mother and is the oldest of six siblings. Growing up, Chad took to music at an early age. Eventually, friends from his neighborhood, North 9th Street and 4th Avenue, encouraged Chad to hone his craft. At the tender age of 8, Chad was determined to use his music as an avenue to make it out of the streets. Some of Chad’s influences include Tupac, Jadakiss, Jay-Z and of course New Jersey natives, Naughty By Nature.\n\nAside from his Hip Hop roots, Chad B is arguably the sole driving force behind the re-creation of EDM music genre “Jersey Club”.  A sound he has since defined as “Hyrbid EDM”, which combines high energy, fast-paced beats with smooth harmonized catchy lyrics. Between his eccentric style, humble demeanor and profound lyrical content, Chad B is a refreshing look into the soul of both Hip Hop and Dance music.\n\nFeeling the strong urge to reconnect with his most loyal fans Chad B is focused on a delivering his first Dance album entitled “Ear Candy” summer 2016. Chad B stated, “I am eager to get back in the EDM &amp; dance circuits with this album, I am very anxious to let the world hear my new sound and production!”\n\n“What you put into this game is what determines your return &amp; my return will be my legacy”\n\n– Chad B\n\nRepping  Jersey to the fullest. In My Zone a hot hit by  Cascio and Rapper Chad B  heard here on Hot 97 with DJ Enuf\n\nWatching the two voices behind the up-tempo club smash “In My Zone”, it’d be easy to mistake Chad B &amp; Cascio — the latest signees to Entertainment One Music (eOne Music) — as longtime friends. While the Jersey natives have enjoyed solo recognition, their work as a duo began less than a year ago.  “We met completely random,” says Cascio of the group’s origins. “I had made ‘In My Zone’ two summers ago. I got a little buzz, but nothing really happened with it.  A friend of mine heard it and brought it to Chad’s attention, but I didn’t even know that he knew about it.” Chad nods in agreement while Cas continues. “I was in a studio doing a verse for somebody else. He was there doing a verse for someone else… You could say it was fate.”\n\nWatching the two voices behind the up-tempo club smash “In My Zone”, it’d be easy to mistake Chad B &amp; Cascio — the latest signees to Entertainment One Music (eOne Music) — as longtime friends.

Webb Senior High School in North Carolina where his mom encouraged him to participate in many talent shows where he won recognition for poetry, rapping, singing, and dancing.  “I noticed his love for music as early as age nine and I encouraged him to pursue his dreams while maintaining his education,” says Driicky's mother.  Driicky Graham was also encouraged by his high school peers with standing ovation after performing.  He realized then it was time to perfect his craft and take his career to the next level.  Music and dance will become his outlet of expression.\n\nDriicky Graham was noticed at one of his talent showcases by Mr. Cooper of Nu World Era, an independent label in early 2010, shortly after he was signed as his first rap male solo artist.  “I have seen many talented artist, but I signed Driicky Graham because not only was he talented, he was a great listener, he was ambitious, hardworking, dedicated to his craft, and the perfect fit for my new label,” says Mr. Cooper.\n\nDriicky Graham has already had the opportunity to work alongside and receive track appearances from rap artist such as Gucci Mane, Diamond, and Party Boyz.

Taking care of the environment is a responsibility that everyone should feel accountable for. Most of us are already aware of environmentally friendly processes such as recycling to minimize the amount of waste we produce and reduce our carbon footprint. However, a lot of people are unaware of new and upcoming technologies that we can use to help reduce carbon emissions.

Floating is the practice of using sensory deprivation in order to help relax and heal your mind and body. This is achieved by going into either a room, tank or pod which has a depth of 10in of water that is heated to body temperature and saturated with about 1000 pounds of salt! When you lay down, 90% of gravity is removed and you will be floating effortlessly. Think the dead sea, but remove light and sound. This is a great technology for everyone to utilize in their routine. Enhanced meditative states, muscle recovery, working around problems, creating new ideas, are just some of the benefits you will get with this practice. It gets better each time you do it.

We're thrilled to be partnering up with both a gem of a wine &amp; spirits shop, and a local distillery, known for their unique and tasty whiskey-like oak &amp; rye wormwood craft absinthe:\n\n\"Distilled from a high rye thin mash with local NY grains and wormwood before being stave aged in American and French oak. Different from a typical absinthe, we distill and age our wormwood rye  to drink straight like a whiskey. With notes of rye spiciness and smoky oak- no water and no sugar is needed, and no anise or licorice is used. \"\n\nAnd heart cut moonshine:\n\n\"Distilled from a high rye thin mash with local NY rye and corn in small batches at our Brooklyn distillery. Fermenting on the grain and then distilling with fresh grains suspended in the column make for a unique buttery corn and spicy rye taste that distinguishes our moonshine to rival any whiskey. Bottling only a very selective Heart Cut portion brings you face-to-face with the complex grain flavor, broad body, and smooth taste. No swill!\"\n\nWe'll be doing a guided tasting of both spirits, as well as cocktails showcasing the best of the spirits. We will also have cheese &amp; charcuterie &amp; small bites.\n\nDate: Tuesday, July 26, 2016\n\nTime: 6:30-8:30 PM (and onward)\n\nLocation: Mash &amp; Grape, 24 Avenue C, New York\n\nTickets: $18, includes guided tasting of two spirits, two cocktails, light bites; cocktail specials will be available at a cash bar next door\n\nAfter the tasting,  we'll take the cocktail party next door for cocktail specials at Sanatorium, a hospital-themed bar by the creators of Apoteke.\n\nWe hope you can make it, and feel free to invite your lady &amp; gentleman friends!\n\nRSVP soon, as space is limited. \n\nJoin here to receive invitations to Women Who Whiskey events.\n",

        "description": "THE MDFF PRESENTS SERIES is programmed by a group of local filmmakers and writers dedicated to discovering and championing new cinematic voices. This month we present a double-bill of work by rising auteur Matthew Porterfield -  his latest short film Take What You Can Carry and his breakout feature film Putty Hill presented on 35mm.“Putty Hill makes no statement. It looks. It looks with as much perception and sympathy as it is possible for a film to look.”– Roger EbertTAKE WHAT YOU CAN CARRY is a picture of a young woman seen through the interiors she occupies and the company she keeps. A North American living abroad, Lilly aspires to shape an intimate and private place of her own while connecting to the world around her. When she receives a letter from home, it provides the conduit she needs to fuse her transient self with the person she's always known herself to be.PUTTY HILL is a beautifully realized portrait of a close–knit community on the outskirts of Baltimore. At a neighborhood karaoke bar, friends and family gather to remember a young man who passed away. Knowing little about his final days, they attempt to reconstruct his life. In the process, they offer a window onto their own lives, an evocative picture of working class America, dislocated from the progress and mobility around them, but united in pursuit of a shared dream.",

Join us for monthly martial arts screenings that range from classics to Holy Grail obscurities to old school thrills from around Asia. Eagle’s talons slash and tear, flying guillotines zip through the air, evil masters laugh maniacally, and struggling students persevere with pugilistic prowess! &gt;&gt;&gt; Pre-Show Starts at 7:00PM + Feature Starts at 8PM &lt;&lt;&lt;In the days of the Ming dynasty, Chen (Hwang Jang Lee, the high kicking baddie from SNAKE IN THE EAGLE’S SHADOW), a ruthless court official trained in Eagle Claw and coveted the Iron Armour technique, frames General Chow Lu Fong (super kicker John Liu) for the murder of a noted dignitary. Liu is intent on exposing the real killer and clearing his own name. Fong’s only link is a greedy opportunist named Hu Loong (Li Hoi San), who he pursues across country, between dodging additional contract killers, clan sympathizers and Loong’s impartial teacher (Philip Ko Fei). Vexed by Fong’s tenacity, Chen dispatches a bounty hunter, Sheng Yu (Tino Wong), to deliver Fong, but with each encounter, Sheng begins to suspect that Fong and himself are expendable pawns in a greater conspiracy.Directed by Ng See Yuen, producer of Jackie Chan’s breakout hit SNAKE IN THE EAGLE’S SHADOW, INVINCIBLE ARMOUR is classic old school kung fu action with evil bearded masters, high kicks and over the top training sequences.ARMOUR is beloved for it’s stars’ dynamic and diverse kicking methods and Hwang’s signature jumping triple kicks or Liu’s jaw dropping tornado-like moves compensates for the lack of character development. The additional flips, kicks and tumbles are performed by up and coming great stuntmen and choreographers including Corey Yuen Kwai, who went on to handle the fight direction in X-MEN and CHARLIE’S ANGELS, Jackie Chan’s classmate and frequent co-star Yuen Biao and Yuen Shun Yi aka Sunny Yuen, member of the revered Yuen Clan that includes Yuen Woo Ping (THE MATRIX).

Basada en hechos reales y adaptada de un cuento del poeta laureado Alejandro Murguía, la película transporta a los espectadores a barrios rara veces vistos en pantalla.Shown with: Blue Notes",

Elaine is the co-founder of “Kyla’s Quest: medical cannabis for sick kids”, a non-profit organization supporting the use of cannabis oil for children. She and her husband Chris Nuessler, a retired RCMP officer, have been strong advocates of cannabis and of the people who need this medicine, and Women Grow is thrilled to have them at this eventThe second presenter of the night will be Jennifer Dunne, a Registered Nurse who finds her passion in cannabis nursing. Dunne first recognized the health benefits of cannabis while studying nursing at the University of Saskatchewan in 1998. It was during Dunne’s second year, that she invited a gentleman with MS to speak to the relief that smoking marijuana allowed for him. This initiated Dunne’s professional conviction to facilitate the awareness of the therapeutic benefit of cannabis within the health care community and beyond. As a nurse, Jennifer Dunne strives to advocate for clients by facilitating their understanding of the cannabis plant. Dunne will continue to raise community awareness through the provision of education and through partnership with the medical community to increase patient access to medical cannabis. Getting to know the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) was Dunne’s “ah-ha” moment as a nurse. Such acquired knowledge solidified her desire to carry out the work that she is currently doing. Dunne will continue on her journey of cannabis nursing, as she is very eager to spread the word on this top regulatory system in our human body, called the Endocannabinoid System. Dunne knows her calling to Cannabis Nursing will be a blessed one. Given the sentiment of the evening, Women Grow hopes to raise both awareness and money for a 5-year old local boy from Nelson, Alistair Bellefeuille, who is battling diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a very difficult to treat, aggressive brain cancer. Donations will be able to be made at this event to help Alistair and his family with the costs of his many medical treatments and therapies.\nF.A.Q.Who attends?

        "description": "Adaptations and interpretations of Charles Dickens' immortal A CHRISTMAS CAROL are never hard to find, but there are very few that can match director Brian Desmond-Hurst's 1951 filming of the story, with the astonishing Alastair Sim as the avaricious, unfeeling Ebenezer Scrooge.Born in Scotland, Sim enjoyed a long and prosperous career, appearing in such films as GREEN FOR DANGER, THE BELLES OF ST. TRINIAN'S, AN INSPECTOR CALLS and THE RULING CLASS. He was never more perfectly cast, however, than in A CHRISTMAS CAROL (released in some markets as SCROOGE), in which he unforgettably embodies the world's worst boss, nastiest uncle and least lovable senior citizen.Shot in stark black and white, this CHRISTMAS CAROL is intensely atmospheric and sometimes somber, as Desmond-Hurst and his cinematography and lighting team stage Scrooge's encounters with the ghosts of Jacob Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come as truly creepy episodes.Yet the film also captures the wonder and warmth of Dickens' tale as we see Sim marvelously move from cold-hearted crank to true believer. It's a tremendously effective telling of the story that you'll never forget. - James Sanford, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema",

        "description": "AUTHENTICALLY YOUWhat does it mean to live our authentic selves and what stops us from living fully real? Is it possible to be authentic in our profession as well as our personal life?\nHosted by internationally acclaimed author, film-maker and co-founder of the Montreal-based Consulting firm Think8 Systems, Nancy's Roundtable is a guided forum of like-minded women sharing experience and wisdom through the exploration of what it means to be powerful and authentic in real time, in our real lives.Already a much-anticipated monthly event at the Spoke Club, Nancy is launching her Roundtable for the first time in Cambria as an opportunity for new relationships.. \"As professional women, we have gained a lot of wisdom and experience but rarely do we get to share it with each other. It is even more rare to talk openly and honestly about the issues that challenge us and keep us from living authentically, both personally and professionally.\"In her professional work with women to find their purpose and align it to their lives, Nancy wanted to connect women on a deeper level of conversation and support.“I feel so blessed to have been a part of the evening's discussions and to have met you and watched you in action. You truly are a gentle and supportive teacher. Your process and methods for guiding us through our own internal processes, allowing us to find our own compass so that we can find our way to our own truth, was a pleasure to watch and experience. I am very much looking forward to your next workshop, you can count on me being there with a friend or two in tow!” -L.J.Nancy’s Roundtable is held one night a month to do just that; tackle nitty-gritty topics with other women who want to share and grow.The evening is 2 hours long (longer if you stick around after to chat) and is $45 which includes your food and beverage for the evening. We look forward to seeing you, and bring a friend. It’s a wonderful way to spend an evening. This event has a capacity of 25 attendees so book early as the Roundtables tend to sell out fast.",

Unfurling like a dream, the video expands to consider recent psychological studies investigating empathy that find increased stress levels and shorter life spans for the individuals doing the caring. How do we name the value of this costly connection?” - Kera MacKenzie, Andrew Mausert-MooneySpeculumRichard Ashrowan17 min., Video, 2014, United Kingdom“Speculum is a moving image sigil, a rehabilitation of the present though the prism of the past. The work explores ancient theories of matter in which luminous emanation gives rise to physical form, drawing on the early light philosophers Roger Bacon (1214-1292), Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486-1535) and John Dee (1527-1609).” - Richard AshrowanNight NoonShambhavi Kaul11 min., Video, 2014, Mexico/USA\"Shambhavi Kaul's Night Noon sets up dialectical dread in Death Valley with a series of uncanny shots of eroded, geological formations and dunes that seemingly fold into night skies and shimmering waters.

The circular camera path moves inside and back out of a Foley stage in Burbank, California.  While portraying sound artists at work, typically invisible support mechanisms of filmmaking are exposed, as are, by extension and quotation, governmental violations of individual privacy.  The scene being foleyed is the final sequence from The Conversation, where Gene Hackman’s character Harry Caul tears apart his room searching for a ‘bug’ that he suspects has been covertly planted. The look of Caul’s apartment as he tears it apart mirrors the visual chaos of the Foley stage. This mirroring is also evident in the dual portraits of sonic espionage expert Caul and Foley artist Gregg Barbanell, for whom professionalism is marked by an invisibility of craft. And in the doubling produced by Hackman’s second appearance as a surveillance hack, twenty-four years later in Enemy of the State.  These filmic quotations ground Hacked Circuit, evoking paranoia, and a sense of conviction alongside a lack of certainty about what is visible. The complication of the seen, the known, the heard and the undetectable provides thematic parallels between the stagecraft of Foley and a pervasive climate of government surveillance.” -  Deborah Stratman",

Or Gary Busey and that meatball sub. Thanks to the incredible eye of director Kathryn Bigelow, Point Break is the visual embodiment of an adrenaline rush. Part surf movie, part bank robber, all badass, every scene is turned all the way up to eleven and doesn’t stop for a moment to catch its breath. Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a rookie FFFFF-BBBBBB-IIIIIIII Agent. His partner, Pappas (Busey) loves meatball subs way more than Utah, but Utah doesn’t let that get him down. They’re investigating a case of bank robberies pulled off by men in ex-Presidents masks. Naturally this leads them to the beach and Utah goes undercover to infiltrate a local surf gang lead by golden god Bohdi (Swayze). Need we say more? We didn’t think so. Point Break has amassed an incredible cult following, and for good reason: there’s a chase scene that involves someone on fire and a dog being thrown. Who throws a dog?! Answer: someone in a badass Kathryn Bigelow movie, that’s who. Join us in celebration of love and Kathryn Bigelow at the third month MUFF Society screening.#MUFFSociety #PointBreak",

After an explosive personal disagreement, the three men part ways, but thirty years later Oskar returns for one last show with his estranged partners. Life has taken its toll on the three men, as each struggles with old age and broken family ties. With the eyes of the nation upon them, they must stage their greatest performance yet while facing the life and people they left behind.

These and other questions take Seifert on a journey from his family’s table to Haiti, Paris, Norway, and the lobby of agra-giant Monsanto, from which he is unceremoniously ejected.

This summer Greg became enamoured with all the terrific Korean food and products available along Bloor and began to incorporate some of these flavours into new recipes, such as his Gangam Style braised beef short ribs featured at his latest Supper Club at The Dep.\n\nThis workshop, Greg's last of 2013, has two parts: a fun and informative afternoon shopping trip through P.A.T. Central Market on Bloor, the biggest Korean supermarket in central Toronto, and a hands-on cooking workshop at The Dep in the evening. \n\nThe workshop menu includes:\n\nGangam-Style Korean Braised Short Ribs (Gal-Bi Jim). \nBeef short ribs cooked in a sweet black rice vinegar glaze, jacked with garlic, chilis and hints of Sichuan spices. Served with steamed rice and a selection of kimchi and banchan (Korean pickles and appetizers).\n\nForbidden Rice Pudding\n\nGreg turns black rice (a grain at one time eaten exclusively by the Chinese Emperor) into a rich, creamy and delicate dessert enlivened with a mix of exotic tropical fruits.\n\nGuided Shopping Trip: $25 +HST\nWorkshop: $40 +HST\n\nShopping Trip + Workshop Combo: $60 +HST\n\nBook Now \n\nIt would not be hyperbole to suggest that Greg Couillard is one of the most influential chefs in Toronto's culinary history. Through groundbreaking restaurants like The Parrot, Stelle, Avec, Sarkis, The Spice Room and many others, his prescient embrace of this city's multicultural flavours and ingredients revolutionized fine dining in Toronto, and foreshadowed the eclectic, international menus many now take for granted.\n\nLearn more about Workshops at The Depanneur\nhttp://thedepanneur.ca/workshops/",

        "description": "“Old ideas can sometimes use new buildings. New ideas must use old buildings.“ (Jane Jacobs, Writer and Activist, 1916 – 2006)\n\nMembers of Ottawa’s New Edinburgh neighbourhood pride themselves on the built history that has manifested itself within the 3 block by 6 block historic core of the community.  This nucleus is a fascinating case study of the challenges facing Canadian homeowners as resources continue to increase in value and our buildings continue to deteriorate.\n\nOf the 13 million dwelling units in Canada, about 85% are more than 10 years old.  The vast majority of those buildings need some form of improvement and approximately 10% of them need major repairs right now to avoid becoming uninhabitable or unaffordable.\n\nIt is within places like New Edinburgh that professionals within the planning, design and building industry need to refine the art and science of creating better living places.  Although our expectations of developments on new urban fringes must continue to rise, we need to focus more of our efforts on improving the quality of the buildings and neighbourhoods we have already created.\n\nAlthough there are many benefits of building better buildings; as long as the proverbial money tree remains a fantasy, the financial benefit will remain the one factor that motivates the masses toward change.  Many owners of average sized 50 – 100 year old homes must bear monthly energy bills of $1,000 or more.   The financial stability of millions of Canadian homeowners is dependent in part upon the industry’s ability to rebuild the existing urban environment.\n\nWith modest changes to conventional building practices, many owners of older homes could realize a reduction in energy costs of more than 50%.  The Passive House building standard encourages a superior level of performance, with homes typically using 10 – 20% of the energy consumed by a conventional building.\n\nAt the corner of Crichton Street and Dufferin Road VERT saw an opportunity to demonstrate our capacity for change, toward an improved Canadian urban environment, within the constraints of an existing Heritage Conservation District.

Legend goes that Toei went “You can make this over our dead body”, so short of murdering the Toei executives, Sands did the next best thing: he made it without their permission. Sands built his own 99 cent super hero costumes, shot swaths of jaw dropping violence, and then he mashed together his poverty row footage with action sequences stolen from the KAMEN RIDER TV show. The result is a fever dream that features a barrage of goofy monsters, blood drinking metal men and a titular hero that crushes villains to death with an eerily gleeful zeal. You have never seen anything like it. In fact, the film has never received a proper release in North America!TAKE NOTE! The Laser Blast Film Society will be presenting HANUMAN AND THE FIVER RIDERS with exclusive subtitles. Enjoy all the monster mashing and exsanguination of the original, but with a brand new story story about life, love and the challenges of following your dreams. Truly, a film for the entire family!

More than a decade in the making, Klahr’s densely constructed magnum opus is “a valiant attempt to reconcile the existential mysteries of the past with the enduring burdens of the human condition” (Jordan Cronk, Cinema Scope), and “one of the finest cinematic achievements of the year” (Manohla Dargis, New York Times). Sixty Six is cover featured in the latest issue of Cinema Scope.Named one of the top five experimental filmmakers of the 2000s by Film Comment, Lewis Klahr is a Los Angeles-based artist and Guggenheim Fellow who has been hand-making films since 1977. Specializing in collage, he has exhibited internationally, including at the Whitney Biennial, and his work has been purchased by New York’s Museum of Modern Art, where Sixty Six debuted in December.",

By plotting these tales together, we uncover how every aspect of our lives is controlled by one factor: the size of the gap between rich and poor. The Divide, which premiered at Sheffield DocFest last year, was described as “brilliant” by Ed Miliband when he saw it at the Open City Film Festival in London. The film is on general cinematic release from 22nd April 2016.View the trailer: https://vimeo.com/137598224Please note that the Underground Cinema does not have disabled access.",

You get to be entertained, have fun, watch Jesus being whipped, crucified and resurrected in glorious TODD AO cinemascope AND sing and dance to one of the catchiest musicals ever written.  I know it all by heart.  It changed my life.  To have those stories from the bible - which I had to learn at school - suddenly come to life as rock opera was mind-blowing.   Then to see Norman Jewison cast it so perfectly and move the camera with such amazing dolly shots and have Rob Iscove (ANOTHER Canadian) design the dance numbers with such trippy energy and verve was inspiriting.  Enjoy!\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Broadway rock opera, Jesus Christ Superstar recounts the last days of Jesus Christ (Ted Neeley) from the perspective of Judas Iscariot (Carl Anderson), his betrayer. As Jesus' following increases, Judas begins to worry that Jesus is falling for his own hype, forgetting the principles of his teachings and growing too close to the prostitute Mary Magdalene (Yvonne Elliman). After Jesus has an outburst in a temple, Judas turns on him. Neeley and Anderson were nominated for two Golden Globe Awards in 1974 for their portrayals of Jesus and Judas, respectively, and the film remains popular, winning a 2012 Huffington Post competition for \"Best Jesus Movie\". Join us for this rollicking, wild '70s ride through the bible!",

        "description": "Get ready for a great night of comedy as the Push Comedy Theater presents a comedy invasion!!!3 acclaimed groups!  1 night of kick ass improv!!!!Glassworks:Glassworks, based out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, is the comedy trio of Alex Raney, Mack Hastings, and Elliot Heinz. Focusing on relationships, honesty, and the present moment, Glassworks crafts truly unique comedy. With over six years of rehearsals, shows, and 12-hour van rides on any of their six national tours, the performers share an infectious synergy. It's truth in comedy, but not like you've seen it before.From Justin to Kelly:Acclaimed as one of the best improv duos in the nation, longtime New York City comedians Justin Peters and Kelly Buttermore perform fully improvised one-act plays that are usually funny, sometimes disturbing, and always memorable. Whether they’re playing two lonely old ladies sunning themselves at a deserted public pool, or a down-on-their-luck married couple celebrating their anniversary with a furtive tryst in their kids’ treehouse, Peters and Buttermore emphasize high-stakes scenework that embraces the terror and potential of the present tense.The Pushers:The Pushers are Virginia's premiere sketch and improv comedy group.  For ten years they have thrilled (and shocked) audiences with their wild antics both on and off stage.  The group puts on a racy, high-octane, energetic show that is guaranteed to have audiences howling with laughter.   The Pushers have appeared at both The Charleston Comedy Festival and The North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival.  In New York, they have performed at The People's Improv Theater, The Upright Citizen's Brigade and at The Kraine Theater in New York's East Village.From Justin to Kelly (NYC) + Glassworks (WI) + The Pushers (NFK)Thursday, November 19th at the Push Comedy TheaterThe show start at 8pm and costs $10 Acclaimed Improv Groups to Tour East Coast On November 13, 2015, the New York City-based improv duo From Justin to Kelly and the Eau Claire, Wisconsin-based improv trio Glassworks will make improv history by hitting the road for a nine-day, nine-show tour of East Coast comedy theaters. It is the first time that two independent improv groups have embarked on a joint tour of this magnitude. Barring catastrophe, it will not be the last. The First-Ever Tour of its Kind Improv comedy groups are traditionally tied to specific theaters, and will only leave those theaters to perform at comedy festivals, if at all. Glassworks and From Justin to Kelly are among the very few established improv groups nationwide that have decided to flip this model and make the road their “home theater.” In doing so, Glassworks and From Justin to Kelly hope to blaze a path that other groups can follow. They have patterned themselves on the many independent musicians who build their audiences through regular, DIY touring. This East Coast tour will mark Glassworks’ seventh national improv tour, and From Justin to Kelly’s fourth. Tour Dates Friday, November 13 - Arcade Comedy Theater Pittsburgh, Pa. Saturday, November - 14 Harrisburg Improv Theatre Harrisburg, Pa. Sunday, November 15 - House Show Brooklyn, N.Y. Monday, November 16 - House Show Brooklyn, N.Y.

Rad moved to the U.S. to shoot his dream project, a rampaging gutter epic of crime, revenge, cop sex and raw power. Just 26 years later, he completed an American action film masterpiece that the world is still barely ready for today: DANGEROUS MEN.After Mina witnesses her fiancé's brutal murder by beach thugs, she sets out on a venomous spree to eradicate all human trash from Los Angeles. Armed with a knife, a gun, and an undying rage, she murders her way through the masculine half of the city's populace. A renegade cop is hot on her heels, a trail that also leads him to the subhuman criminal overlord known as Black Pepper.It's a pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, brain-devouring onslaught of '80s thunder, '90s lightning, and pure filmmaking daredevilry from another time and/or dimension.

The event will be held Saturday, November 28 from 12pm-4pm at hackerYou (483 Queen St W, Toronto, 3rd floor).The day will be hosted by local letterers (and Ligatures co-founders) Kyle Gallant &amp; Christopher Rouleau. Kyle is a multi-faceted designer, skilled in calligraphy, expressive lettering, and even graffiti. He is a self-described “compulsive doodler” and passionate about all things type. Christopher is a freelance graphic designer &amp; letterer, with a love for alphabets, antique lettering guides and old hand-lettered signs. He is comfortable working in a variety of media, including pen, chalk, acrylic, ink… the list goes on.Check out more of their recent work on Instagram: http://instagram.com/eckstatic   |  http://instagram.com/chris_rouleau  After the popularity of Kyle &amp; Christopher’s brush pen workshops in Toronto and Calgary, they have pooled together their skills, knowledge and resources to put together a 4-hour tutorial on the fundamentals of digital lettering to take your work from the page to the screen – and beyond.  Pre-requisites: \nLigatures brush pen workshop (suggested) \nbasic working knowledge of Adobe Illustrator  \nRequirements: \nlaptop \nAdobe CS (CS5 or higher) \na Dropbox account (for file sharing) \nscanned lettering work(s) you would like to digitize  \nCost: The cost of this full-day workshop is $80 ($60 with valid student ID, presented on workshop day). This price includes digital exercises, handouts, course instruction, as well as access to personal books and resources. Course plan: This 4-hour workshop will help budding letterers convert their lettering and calligraphy work into versatile vector files, perfect for all print and web uses. Half of the workshop will be dedicated to reviewing the digital toolkit (including the beloved pen tool), an overview of building beziers, and tips on making the most of Illustrator’s auto-trace, with plenty of demos and exercises. The latter half of the workshop will be allocated for one-on-one time with the instructors to ask questions and perfect your work. Participants will leave the workshop with at least one completed vector file, and the skills to continue their digital lettering journey.  We look forward to bringing your talents together, sharing knowledge with one another, and creating some new brush pen work work!

        "description": "You already know that being a teenager is hard. On top of all of the general awkwardness, it's even harder with crazy moms, mean girls, and cute guys who want nothing to do with you because you're a total square, plus the pressure of wondering if anyone will ask you to prom. If you're dealing with all of these things and also happen to have telekinetic powers that are seemingly uncontrollable... well then soooooouie, life must be impossible. But you don't have to worry about that, because luckily for you, you're not Carrie. (Unless you are, in which case I'm sorry I called you a total square, please don't hurt me with your mind powers.)Brian De Palma's bloody masterpiece Carrie will be screening at The Royal as a part of our Halloween Spooktacular, and we can't wait to relive all of the memories that we've already worked hard on repressing about high school. I mean, high school was bad, but I guess at least it wasn't that bad. If blood-splattered high school gymnasiums aren't you thing, then at least come and witness John Travolta as Billy Nolan, with better hair than I could ever dream of having. Because if you don't come, remember, they're all going to laugh at you!",

This electrifying revenge-thriller pits one man against the world around him as he sacrifices everything and everyone he loves to avenge his father’s murder.Young Hamlet’s world is turned upside down when, after the death of his father, his mother quickly marries Hamlet’s uncle Claudius. When the ghost of Hamlet’s father appears before him to accuse Claudius of murder, Hamlet is set upon a course of action which will have significant consequences for everyone that he holds dear. Hamlet is gripping tragedy fueled by grief and framed by a world dominated by the politics of fear.Both newcomers to Hamlet and Shakespeare aficionados will delight in this version; a perfect match for Driftwood’s inventive theatrical style and our magical outdoor settings.",

Introduction and Q&amp;A with Michael Lerman,writer of Man From Reno at the following screenings:• Saturday August 1st, 7PM - Q&amp;A• Sunday August 2nd, 7PM - Intro• Friday August 7th, 7PM - Q&amp;A A stranger in the increasingly strange city of San Francisco, Japanese crime novelist Aki (Ayako Fujitani - Tokyo!) is unsure of precisely what role she has to play in a real-life murder mystery involving ambiguous MacGuffins and amorphous identities. Unfolding in lonely places such as bookshops and hotel bars, Dave Boyle's (Surrogate Valentine, White On Rice, Big Dreams Little Tokyo) moody thriller uncovers exhilarating new takes on genre conventions. Consequently, it's an alluring l'homme fatal who supplies Aki with the breadcrumb trail of clues that entices her into a labyrinthine plot of sinister dealings. In turn, the aging sheriff (veteran character actor Pepe Serna - Scarface, The Black Dahlia, The Jerk, fantastic in a rare leading role), who should rightfully be riding to her rescue, proves to be equally out of his depth. The game is afoot, the chase is exhilarating and the stakes are perilously high in this inspired neo-noir. (Courtesy of Los Angeles Film Festival)",

Linking your classroom to the concert hall, this program provides extensive standards-based teacher and student materials and culminates in an interactive orchestral concert in which students actively participate from their seats.  This year's Link Up program, The Orchestra Rocks, explores rhythm as the universal element of music.  Composers and musicians play with elements of musical time, creating patterns of sound and silence that are expressive and exciting.  A consistent groove can unite musicians, singers, and audiences in an experience of listening and performing together.  Through the Link Up repertoire, hands-on-activities, and a culminating interactive performance with the San Antonio Symphony, we will discover how the orchestra rocks!  ",

Wednesday May 27 @ 7:00pm - FALLING STAR (STELLA CANDENTE)Dir./Scr. Luis Miñarro11 Gaudi ® award nominations 2015! Colourful feature debut from experienced producer Miñarro offers an almost hallucinatory look into the world of Amadeo van Savoy, who for two years was king of an ungovernable Spain around 1870. This intriguing episode is transformed into a plea for beauty, creativity and joy.At first sight, Falling Star presents itself as a historic film about the brief rule of Amadeo van Savoy, a prince from Turin who was king of Spain for two years. His mainstay, the powerful General Prim, was murdered before Amadeo was properly installed and then he had no one to fall back on; Spain in 1871 was already plagued by administrative and financial crises. Wednesday June 3 @ 7:00pm - MARSHLAND (LA ISLA MÍNIMA)Dir./Scr. Alberto Rodríguez10 Goya ® Award Winner 2015! Named the film of the year by critics and audience alike.The Spanish deep South, 1980. A series of brutal murders of adolescent girls in a remote and forgotten town bring together two disparate characters – both detectives in the homicide division – to investigate the cases. With deep divisions in their ideology, detectives Juan and Pedro must put aside their differences if they are to successfully hunt down a killer who for years has terrorized a community in the shadow of a general disregard for women rooted in a misogynistic past. From the creators of Unit 7, MARSHLAND is the new thrilling movie by talented director Alberto Rodriguez, who surprised us with Unit 7 and 7 Virgins.",

Kyriakos Tofaridis / 2013 / 94 minutesHigh above the planet, English satellites discover large oil deposit in the area of the Old Mines in Cyprus. As it turns out, a substantial part of the area belongs to Greek-Cypriot man who bought it from his Turkish Cypriot colleague and has retired there with his wife. Events beyond their quiet property soon begin to encroach on the peaceful retired couple. The international economic crisis forces the man’s two sons to move their families into the house. This situation is made worse when the Cyprus government keeps asking to buy the house to capitalize on the oil reserves. Soon enough, two English oil company agents arrive and camp outside the house, hoping to cash in. Sounding echoes of Bill Forsyth’s LOCAL HERO, Tofardis’s BLOCK 12 is a wry and charming comedy. English sub-titles.Du haut du ciel, des satellites anglais ont repéré un gisement pétrolier dans la région des Vieilles Mines à Chypre.

Even when we don't FEEL grateful, we can still practice. Gratitude not only has a positive ripple effect on our physical, emotional, and mental health, it makes us more resilient, joyful, and creative.  It transforms what we have into enough.More than enough.Simply put, gratitude rocks! At this workshop, you will create and take home a gratitude kit + a plan to put it into action + a whole pile of inspiration! You will tap into your creative spirit and together we will make magic.This kit will create a whole-hearted ripple of love throughout your life, and those around you.Cost: $45 (price includes all supplies and HST).If you would like to avoid the Eventbrite fee, I will happily accept email money transfers to kateUdurie@gmail.com.Please note: Once registered, refunds are not available.Love from a past workshop: http://nicole-belanger.com/2014/02/12/a-small-town-trip-with-big-time-gratitude/ (by Nicole Belanger)\"Life is not a straight line. Speed bumps, setbacks, ups and downs. Big ups. Big downs. Big wins. Big losses. And so so many in betweens. Life comes with a whole pile of hopes, assumptions, expectations and beliefs. How life \"should\" go. But as you and I both know, sometimes life doesn't go as planned. We get stuck. We get lost. We get hurt.The remedy? Gratitude. And gratitude ... is a PRACTICE.Gratitude has the ability to pull us into the now. To pause. It has magnetic energy that grows and expands and attracts possibility to everything it touches. When we focus on what and who we are grateful for, transformation follows. You will be changed. You will spread change. It’s a practice and it takes practice. It's not about waiting for things to happen, to be perfect, to be extraordinary - it is your gratitude practice that will shift the way you see the ordinary, the every day. Your gratitude kit will give you the skills, tools, ideas, and momentum to keep your gratitude practice going throughout the entire year…and beyond.When we embody, express, and spread gratitude our heart feels lighter, brighter, and whole. Gratitude changes our perspective. Gratitude strengthens our work and our relationships – with those we love, and with our SELF – because gratitude gives as much to the sender as the receiver.\"- Kate",

Действие же возможно только здесь и сейчас, где мы находимся в настоящий момент, потому что прошлое уже закончилось, а будущее ещё не состоялось.

It not only preserves food but also enhances the flavour and nutrient content. Cultures go to work to makes the minerals in fermented foods more readily available to the body. As an added bonus, the active cultures also produce B vitamins and enzymes that are beneficial for digestion. From pickles to kimchee and sauerkraut, the value of these foods in our diet is hard to...beet...and worth the effort.\n\nCulturing or fermenting a food involves a chemical process that breaks down a complicated substance into simpler parts. The Fresh City canning team will show you just how to break down the art of fermentation into its simplest parts and have fun filling your pantry with this autumn’s harvest. You’ll be surprised what a blast it is to learn and how much money your new found cultural skills will save you. \n\nThis is a 2 hour, hands-on class and you’ll be taking your own jar home with you to watch over and protect while it finishes! \n\nWednesday Location:\nDemo Kitchen at the Uniiverse head office\n2nd floor, 111 Jarvis St., Toronto",

With hospitality so close to the heart of Tunisian culture, it should be no surprise that it also abounds with fantastic food.\n\nDali Chehimi has put together a delightful menu featuring several classic Tunisian dishes, many rarely seen in Toronto.\n\nOmmek Houria\nA spicy Tunisian starter, somewhere between a salad and a dip, made with sweet braised carrots combined with Dali's homemade harissa, garlic and olive oil. A popular dish to break the Ramadan fast.\n\nBrik a l'Oeuf\nThis is the best-known version of Brik (pronounced breek), a Tunisian dish consisting of thin \"warka\" pastry wrapped around a  variety of fillings. In Brik a l'Oeuf, a whole raw egg is included with chopped onion, tuna, harissa and parsley, before it is fried to golden crisp. There is a Tunisian tradition where a bride-to-be's mother makes brik for the potential bridegroom — if the bridegroom eats it without spilling any of the egg yolk, he may marry the bride!\n\nChicken with Preserved Lemons and Green Olives\nThis is a classic North African tagine, or stew, named after the conical earthenware pots they are typically cooked in. This dish combines the aromatic citrus of homemade preserved lemons with briny, earthy green olives and tender chicken to great effect. Served with tri-color couscous.\n\nGreen Tea and Artisanal Baklava\nDinner ends with a cup of classic Tunisian tea and a selection of fine North African pastries.\n\nJUST ANNOUNCED: Danny Castricone, wine broker and owner of Mondo Vino has offered to supply two exclusive wines paired with Chef Dali Chehimi's Tunsian Supper Club on Oct. 5: White: Cantina Nals Margreid from Alto Adige — 2012 Pinot Bianco Penon DOC, and Red: Azienda Agricola Le Salette from Veneto — 2012 Valpolicella Classico DOCG.

Growing up part of the Palop Community Eddy always felt electrified by Kizomba.\n\nIn 1998 he began his career as a promoter in Lisbon orchestrating parties which he continued after moving to London in October 2009.\n\nEddy’s immense love, passion and knowledge of Kizomba was recognized by respected Kizomba teacher Norma Facey and Eddy humbly credits her for starting his teaching career around March 2010.\n\nThat same year he founded Pitanga Dance Group as a platform for promoting authentic Kizomba through teaching and performance with a focus on enriching the student’s learning experience by acknowledging the origins of the music and dance. Eddy is known for a teaching style submersed in history and musicality which he believes are fundamental in producing top quality dancers and he is confident the success of his method is demonstrated each time his students take the dance floor.\n\nEddy’s interests include reading, playing chess, watching movies, listening to music and while he’s a self-proclaimed futebol fanatic his real passion is travelling the world dancing and teaching others about Kizomba.  Here’s a partial list of countries and festivals where Eddy has taught.\n\nCountries: UK, Jamaica, Croatia, Finland, France, Portugal, Spain, Serbia, USA, Greece, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Italy, Poland, Estonia, Holland, Russia, Israel\n\nCongresses and Festivals:  Áfricadançar, Batuke, Swimming Festival, Sensual Dance, Feeling Festival, Open Spain, Paris Tentação, Luxembourg International Kizomba Festival, Miami Beach Festival, Mambo City 5 Stars, Pointins, Fitness Weekender, Kent Salsa Festival, Salsa Splash, Salsa Splash Alicante, Bachaturo, and Kizomba Congress in Holland.\n\nVideos:\n\nEddy &amp; Lucia Semba\n\nEddy &amp; Adda Semba\n",

This unrivaled collection of 181 Renoir works, largely paintings from his ‘late period’, will promote a fresh look at one of the 20th century’s greatest artists, and help to explore why Renoir has polarised opinion for over 100 years.Renoir - Revered and Reviled will offer a rare opportunity to see these extraordinary artworks on the big screen, which have never before travelled to the UK and are never loaned. Beloved Impressionist, influential master or self-indulgent fantasist? You decide.Pierre Auguste Renoir is known and loved for his impressionist paintings. But Renoir himself grew tired of this style and radically changed course. This film – based on the remarkable never loaned collection of 181 Renoirs at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia – examines the new direction he took and why it provokes such extreme reactions even today.",

        "description": "People, energy or space : what is more important to drive design?Hurley Palmer Flatt240 Blackfriars Road, London, SE1 8NWWhat is it that drives design? We have selected three critical items that help shape the buildings we design:Space: the ever pressing challenge of maximising square meterage, be it to provide ample accommodation or to maximise returns on investment;People: providing the most ‘comfortable’ environment, one that enhances senses and allows occupiers to be more productive in whatever they are doing.Energy: the drive to reduce energy consumption and carbon emission, heightened by the tightening of regulations or by clients’ CSR aspirationsBut which of these is more important? Most often there are clear champions for each of these areas: developers wanting more space, architects wanting the most of people experience and sustainability consultants pushing for the energy performance. With a short presentation of work we have been undertaking in recent projects in the three areas, we wish to discuss perceived conflicts and possible synergies between the three aspects. We believe an optimum balance can be achieved and it is always intrinsically related to each project, but how often is this reached?Join the discussion at our new offices at 240 Blackfriars Road!",

Adam Green's Aladdin is about a failed recording artist in a papier-mache techno-dystopia who uses the wish-granting (or wish-printing), unmistakably phallic lamp to woo the corrupt sultan's decadent daughter and ends up remaking the world. Utterly original, profanely satirical, and eons from Disney.",

        "description": "Taking place in the late, desperate hours of the night, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS finds press agent Sidney Falco out of favor with powerful columnist J.J. Hunsecker and resorting to increasingly slimy measures to turn that around. Tasked with breaking up a romance between J.J.'s fragile sister Susie and jazz guitarist Steve Dallas, Sidney finds their bond is as unwavering as J.J.'s resolve to end it. Sidney's clients lash out against him, wondering what they are paying him for.Phone calls go unreturned and meetings are refused, with Sidney's charms only occasionally swaying a secretary here and there. Reeling with desperation, Sidney tracks down J.J. in the middle of a meeting with a senator and the pretty young thing he is trying to help make it, and we get a taste of how brazen and ruthless J.J. can be. He even pals around with a threatening, corrupt police lieutenant that clearly owes him some favors.The poison spreads from character to character as Sidney enlists other creatures of the night to facilitate a smear campaign that paints Steve as a pot-smoking commie. J.J. is then to come to Steve's rescue, thus absolving himself of being a part of the takedown. Setting up the trap, Sidney knows that Steve's strength of character breaks apart with his pride, and Steve falls right in with harsh words against J.J. that will make it impossible for him to be with Susie.Hollywood nice guys Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster have their personas inverted here as two morally reprehensible men whose power plays turn them to monsters. As the sycophantic Sidney, Curtis moves quickly through each scene, perfectly filling out a shifty, soulless body. The sharp, cynical dialogue cuts deep, and the moment of redemption that we've come to expect may not be reached. Although Sidney Falco does bite back with the line \"It's one thing to wear a dog collar; when it turns into a noose I'd rather have my freedom\" but rather than walking away, he is easily manipulated back into the 21 Club booth.-Alamo Drafthouse ",

        "description": "Welcome to a world where people's worst impulses and darkest desires are stimulated by a landscape of synth-pop and bright neon lights. Nothing is quite as it seems as you surrender yourself to the dazzling sights and soothing sounds of the Neon Dreams Cinema Club, a monthly film series exclusive to The Royal Cinema bringing you the best in delightfully surreal neo-noir cinema from the 70's, 80's, and beyond.Pre-show starts at 7:00pmFeature starts at 8:00pmVISIT THE EVENT PAGE&gt;&gt;HERE&lt;&lt;This 35mm presentation is made possible thanks to our lovely sponsor Sonic Boom and will be preceded by a mind-shattering pre-show, featuring a themed video mixtape of music, film, and television to put you in the right mood. As always this will be a lisenced event, courtesy of Monarch Tavern, and there will be AMAZING PRIZES given out to many lucky patrons. Be sure to arrive early!======After Junior (Alec Baldwin) is released from prison, he plans on starting a new life in Miami. But when he kills a man in the airport, he flees the scene and finds Susie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a mild-mannered prostitute searching for stability. The two opposites become romantically involved, and Junior steals a badge and gun from a veteran detective (Fred Ward). Using the officer's identity, Junior embarks on a crime spree and convinces Susie that he is the perfect man.\"George Armitage's Miami Blues is another film slightly ahead of its time. In 1990 its combination of tough, funny noir and flashes of shocking violence seemed to bemuse audiences. Only five years later would Tarantino turn what was once for cult appreciation only into a global smasheroo. This very entertaining Miami lowlife romp has at its heart two great badass performances, the grizzled Fred Ward as Hoke Mosely and the frequently shirtless and impressively hairy Alec Baldwin as the charming psychopath Junior. This film is a little gem of broken fingers, lost digits and missing teeth. Anyone who has seen my amateur film Dead Right will know that I stole a joke from Miami Blues.\"- Edgar Wright (director of Shaun Of The Dead, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World)",

Fanning is a singer-songwriter from Dublin, Ireland, living in Berlin. His first release is the single ‘Carmelita’, a stark and haunting picture of the darker side of Dublin City.Fanning’s songs are often lyrically driven, taking inspiration from Irish literary tradition and folk music as well as from 60s psychedelia and gothic rock n roll. Biog:As a child he had little interest in school, and rarely attended, choosing instead to spend his days exploring his father’s book collection and huge array of jazz and blues records. There were always instruments around the house and at the age of 10 he picked up the guitar for the first time. He immediately formed a band with some friends and by the age of 12 they were gigging in pubs around Ireland, playing mostly Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley covers, among some original songs. There was always a lot of literary influence in his life, he came from a family of journalists and writers, his grandfather, A.P. Fanning had a play produced at the home of Irish theatre, The Abbey in Dublin, and Irish literary giants such as Ulick O’Connor, John B. Keane, Anthony Cronin and Brendan Kennelly were fixtures in his upbringing, as friends of the family.His songwriting started to develop in his teens, along with his interest in music production. He bought his first 8-track recorder and started recording, layering multiple instruments and sounds as part of his songwriting process. At the age of 17 formed the band Porn Trauma, who released one EP which reached the top 30 in the Irish charts, and another limited edition 7-inch single, before disbanding. They regrouped as The Last Tycoons who went on to release one eponymous album as well as several EPs and singles. His interest in production continued to grow and he spent as much time in the studio as possible, working as an assistant on legendary Dubliner Ronnie Drew’s final album before his death in 2008. As a multi-instrumentalist he has been in demand to play with acts such as Dublin troubadour The Mighty Stef, Berlin Industrial Electro outfit Suzies Ashes, and Irish songstress Candice Gordon, most recently producing and playing on Gordon's soon to be released debut LP.He now lives in Berlin and is releasing his first single with a debut solo album in the works. The self-produced ‘Carmelita’ is released on November 13th on Proper Octopus Records. Available digitally from usual outlets and on 7-inch vinyl from select stores. ",

Under the guidance of theatre director Sasa, they must fight their demons and overcome prejudice. They decide to base their play on classic Hollywood westerns. As they embrace the stereotypes of the genre – the fight between good and evil, the clash between civilisation and wilderness – the actors develop their stories. As time passes, they start to view the play as a metaphor for their own destinies, and grasp it as the opportunity of a lifetime.",

In deze editie: efficiëntie in het wielrennen aan de hand van vermogensmeters.Dit seizoen hebben we veel belangrijke tijdritten gezien bij de profs. Denk aan de Tour Proloog door Utrecht, de laatste spannende week van de Vuelta, de verrassende race tegen de klok voor de regenboogtrui in de Giro. De lange tijdrit in de 13e etappe bleek een prelude voor meer goede tijdritten voor Team LottoNL-Jumbo met als resultaat een mooie 5e plaats voor Steven Kruijswijk. Een bevestiging dat in de tijdrit de mannen van de enige Nederlandse World-tour ploeg het goed voor elkaar hebben!De grote motor achter het tijdrit succes, coach Mathieu Heijboer blikt dan ook met een tevreden gevoel terug op de resultaten. Ter voorbereiding heeft hij met zijn ploeg een aerotest bij AeroPro gedaan. Tijdens onze infodag “Geen woorden maar data” vertelt Heijboer meer over trap-efficiëntie met de Pioneer vermogensmeter en bekijk je nieuwe nog niet eerder vertoonde beelden van de ploeg.Programma: \n14.00 uur: Inloop\n14.30 uur: Presentaties \nCoach Mathieu Heijboer: De weg naar de succesvolle tijdritten van Lotto Jumbo: De vertaalslag van geavanceerde data naar overwinningen.

Working with government, non-government, corporate and community leaders, he has been the architect of numerous initiatives to address some of society’s most complex and pressing challenges. As a thought leader, Ric’s personal mission is to “change change” – that is, to foster new mindsets and skill-sets to enable society to tackle the transformational challenges of our time in constructive new ways.

        "title": "Lost Histories of World War II",
        "description": "Come hear award-winning authors Raghu Karnad and Terese Svoboda discuss hidden family histories of the Asia theater of World War II. Moderated by N+1 editor Nikil Saval, author of Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.When Raghu Karnad found three sepia-toned photographs at his grandmother’s house, he learned the men they depicted were his grandfather and his brothers-in-laws. All three men had served in World War II as part of the Indian Army. The Indian Army was the largest volunteer army in world history, comprised as it was of 2.5 million men in WWII, even though South Asia itself still lived under the yoke of the British Empire. In his book Farthest Field: An Indian Story of the Second World War (W.W. Norton &amp; Company 2015), Raghu tells the story of these three brothers-in-arms and India’s crucial, lost history in the Second World War. Telling the gripping adventures of guerrilla infiltrators in the jungles of Burma and the Bengal sappers heading off a Japanese invasion of India, the book is--in the words of Booker Finalist Neel Mukherjee--“a bravura feat of literary-historical imagination--the kind that one would normally associate with a novelist.” Hear Raghu talk about the book on NPR Books here.A similar quest to unearth a family member’s past catalyzed Terese Svoboda to write her memoir Black Glasses Like Clark Kent: A GI’s Secret from Postwar Japan (Graywolf Press 2008). When her uncle Don Svoboda suddenly committed suicide following the revelations of the Abu Ghraib abuses, Terese found that he had left behind a secret archive of tape cassettes: his audio confessions about what he did while guarding prisoners in postwar Japan. “The prison was getting overcrowded,” he remarks in one tape, and a captain “said he was going to have to start executing the prisoners, the ones in the death cells.” A memoir both political and personal, Black Glasses documents Terese Svoboda’s visit to Japan and her journey into the archives of this hidden chapter of WWII history. As The Brooklyn Rail writes: \"Svoboda is an excellent companion: consistently candid, razor sharp, unapologetically flawed, and passionate. She is exactly with whom one would want to discuss these difficult topics.\" A Guggenheim Fellow, Terese Svoboda has written five books of poetry, won the NYFA Fellowship three times, and written for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and The Paris Review. Hear her talk about the book on C-Span here.",

        "description": "\nIf you have ever been interested in experiencing the   remarkable effects of meditation, then Sunday   afternoon, June 28, will be of interest to you. Join me from 4:00-6:00 PM to   learn mind-body practices that are proven to:   \nBoost immune function    Enhance creativity    Calm troubled emotions      As a practitioner of   meditation for over 30 years,   I can personally vouch for its capacity to transform old patterns   of self-doubt, anxiety and stress, and unlock hidden potentials within the   personality.   Joining me is special   guest Angel   Yamaguchi, who will introduce Yin Yoga, a novel form of effortless yoga   that allows for extended time in passive, relaxing postures (that anyone can   do). It is known for its restorative effects on body and spirit.   I will   give an overview of four approaches to meditation, some that stretch back into antiquity while others are based   on modern neuroscience research.  I will demystify meditation and make   it possible for anyone to do with immediate results. The information   presented will be useful for the rest of your life.   This event will be   held at a beautiful private yoga studio just a couple of minutes south of   Townlake off S Lamar. \nSee my website to learn more about Four Approaches to Meditation: Four Sundays in July\nI look forward to   sharing this event with you.\n  ",

The barbershop, with its turquoise barber chairs, porcelain sinks, collection of glass bottles of aftershave, vintage postcards from Italy, is more than a workplace - it is a window into an earlier time.” - Nora SweeneyPort NoirLaura Kraning11 min., Video, 2014, USA”Within the machine landscape of Terminal Island, the strata of a 100 year old boat shop provides a glimpse into Los Angeles Harbor’s disappearing past.

        "description": "American indie icon Hal Hartley completes the trilogy he began with Henry Fool and Fay Grim with this delightfully offbeat tale about Henry and Fay’s teenage son, Ned, who emerges from a witness protection program with a single, fixed purpose: to kill his father for ruining his mother’s life.For twenty-five years, Hartley has intrigued audiences with elegantly understated, deadpan-funny films featuring eccentric and endearing casts of misfit characters. He has created a cinematic universe that is uniquely his own, stamping his visual and verbal authority on each film. The film includes Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Fay (Parker Posey), but they are secondary characters in what turns into a loving portrait of their son, Ned (Liam Aiken), now eighteen and recently released from witness protection. Despite the Christian upbringing he received from his foster parent (Martin Donovan), Ned sets out with one goal: to kill his father for having ruined his mother’s life. As the serious and well mannered young man begins his quest for revenge, he finds himself amongst a typical band of Hartley miscreants, including Aubrey Plaza (Parks &amp; Rec) as a grad student obsessed with the work of Ned’s uncle, a former poet laureate.\"Repeating himself without ever lapsing into self-parody, Hartley has made a movie that will seem familiar to his fans, but which also looks, sounds, and moves like nothing else on the current American indie landscape.” - Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, AV Club\"Move over, Boyhood. Hal Hartley completes his bio-trilogy half a dozen years longer than Linklater's decidedly conventional odyssey - an infinitely more dark and daring, toxically tantalizing suburban noir.” - NewsBlaze See the trailer HERE. ",

        "description": "Born and raised in Memphis Tennessee, TL was the oldest child and grandchild to a musical filled family. From the beginning he was born to be a musical Icon.  With his family having their own gospel group and playing almost every instrument, TL picked up on a lot of their talents.  At the age of 3 he started watching his favorite performer, Michael Jackson.  He trained himself vocally by repeating what he heard different singers do. At the same age he taught himself how to play the drums.  TL was aiming himself towards being a musical genius.  At the age of 7 he began to sing and play at his church and as he got older he started singing at many different programs for both school and church.  But he finally reached the point to which he knew this was his life long dream when he won the talent showcase his eleventh grade year in high school.  From there, he took off winning more showcases, and being exposed to greater things. After completing high school he auditioned for “American Idol”, making it through to the next round, but finding that they had all that they could take.  TL went on to sing in many different play productions.Singing with his 1st group, Nu Era, TL had a chance to sing for Dave Hollister.  But years later TL moved on with his musical dreams.  TL later joined with DK, D Jae, and C luv forming a group called Image IV.  At that time TL was going by the name T-love.  These 4 guys together experienced and accomplished a lot all because of their manager, Mercedes Jackson.  Image IV opened up for many different events and artists, such as: Pretty Rickey, Boys II Men, The New Years celebration on Beale Street, Africa in April, All Black Mayors Conference, A&amp;R’S in New York @ the Harlem Bar and Grill, the Mayor’s Christmas ball and headlined a host of citywide talent showcases. They also appeared on channel 3 news twice and on the good morning Memphis News channel 13. They had the chances of meeting Master P, Romeo, Bow Bow, Scott Storch, Omarion, and Tracy Ellis Ross.  Image IV with the help of Mercedes put out a single “At the Party”.After releasing the single, the group departed because of creative differences.  That’s when “T-love” decided to become a solo artist changing his name to “TL”.  TL started his solo career opening up for Tyrese.  Then he went to St. Louis to meet with the St. Lunatics.  TL, also as a solo artist, performed at the city’s Christmas ball and then he opened up for Charlie Wilson and Tamia, Bow Bow and Pleasure P, Performed @ the Memphis Red Birds Game, Master P’s Christmas toy give away, St. Jude’s charity event, Charity for Africa, Living The Dream Concert, Africa in April and featured in the Street Master’s Magazine and many other events.  TL had finished his first solo album “The Love Story” and went on to record his new single “Hypnotized” under his name Terrance Love.  Experiencing a lot over the years TL, now Terrance Love, only knows that the best is yet to come.1luvtl",

Lucy spends most of her time on the telephone, and when Ben, her boyfriend, visits her intending to propose, the telephone keeps ringing, interrupting Ben every time he is about to pop the question. Eventually, the audience and Ben realize that the telephone is not only Lucy's means of remaining connected to the world but also a defence mechanism. Ben decides to penetrate this shield by leaving the apartment and using a pay phone to get through to her. Will Ben finally get through to Lucy? The Medium - MenottiA cautionary tale where Baba poses as a medium with her daughter, Monica, posing as ghosts from the beyond. She takes in Toby, a mute, but distrusts him. The business continues until, during a séance, she feels a 'cold hand' tightening about her throat. When her customers return for another session, she tells them that she is a fake and demonstrates her tricks, but her clients protest that she must be real, that it was not Monica's voice they heard. She drives them out and resolves to cast out Toby as well. Whose hand was around her throat?",

        "title": "Puntero laser comprar barato professional",
        "description": "Un equipo de científicos de la Universidad de Osaka ha proyectado el  laser comprar más poderoso del mundo, equivalente a 1.000 veces el consumo eléctrico mundial.\n\nLos primeros láser se desarrollaron en los años 60, tras décadas de investigación. Fue Einstein quien los fundamentos para esta tecnología y con los años llegaron por goteo los experimentos. Sin embargo, después de las primeras aplicaciones exitosas, el láser se convirtió en una herramienta útil para procesos industriales e incluso para cosas tan cotidianas como leer un CD. Por supuesto la ciencia ficción escogió otros usos para los rayos láser. Especialmente famosas se han hecho las laser verde , como las que se exhibían en Star Wars, cañones láser y demás armas .\n\nY es que a la ciencia ficción le gustan los disparos, la acción y las tecnologías fabulosas que realmente serían un peligro para la Humanidad y, en general, para cualquier cosa viva. La ciencia (sin ficción) se ha centrado en aplicaciones más alejadas del ámbito militar. Sin embargo, esto no quiere decir que la tecnología láser no haya pasado por las manos de los ejércitos y sus unidades de investigación. Sin ir más lejos la marina estadounidense ha desarrollado un rayo láser capaz de incendiar objetivos en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, concentrando toda la energía en un punto. Ni siquiera se ve el haz: el objetivo se incendia y explota.\n\nLa capacidad destructora de esta arma parece descomunal. Su potencia es de 30 KW, es decir, 3.000 vatios. A pesar de todo es laser potente militar una cifra ridícula comparado con los vatios los que despliega el rayor láser más poderoso del mundo. Un equipo de investigadores de la Universidad de Osaka ha establecido el récord recientemente. Los ceros se pierden en el número y, si se reduce a siglas, nos perdemos en las siglas. Son 2 petavatios, lo que equivale a 2.000 billones (de los españoles) de vatios.\n\nEsta es la potencia que despliega el comprar laser potente más poderoso del mundo. Para hacerse una idea (ligera) de lo que significa la cifra se puede decir que esta equivale a 1.000 veces el consumo eléctrico mundial. Sin embargo, la investigación de la Universidad de Osaka no está orientada a fines militares. También hay que destacar que este rayo láser únicamente tiene potencia para hacer funcionar un microondas durante dos segundos.\n\nRayo láser más poderoso del mundo\n\n\n\nEl truco está en que los investigadores japoneses han alcanzado esta potencia extrema concentrando el rayo láser en un tiempo mínimo. De esta forma, la potencia del haz se despliega solamente durante un picosegundo, otra medida desacostumbrada, que quiere decir la billonésima parte de un segundo. Algo que evidentemente no podemos imaginar, pero sí representar, concretamente la abreviatura de picosegundo es ps.\n\nPara desplegar el rayo láser se ha utilizado una estructura llamada LFEX (Laser for Fast Ignition Experiments), cuya longitud es de 100 metros y que se terminó de construir a finales del pasado año. Los responsables del experimento no se quedan aquí. De dos petavatios pretenden pasar a diez petavatios de potencia en el futuro.\n",

        "description": "Sustain at Venue 578 is proud to present Stylust Beats.\n\nJoin us for live art, cirque performances, vendors, and more.\n\nAll AgesDoors at 8PMOpening acts: BOYGOLD and Sleep Madness\n\nCome early for the Sunday Jam with free entry from 2PM-8PM and for $15 AYCD Bloody Mary's and Mimosas with proof of ticket purchase to the show.\n\nKnown for his sleeveless, whimsical synergy with the fans, Geoff “Stylust Beats” Reich has been creating his own counterculture since he was a teenager. A skate punk and hip-hop devotee, this groundbreaking DJ’s talent for fusing rap hooks and dubstep bass with multiple music genres has earned him the rep as a creative renegade carving his own path. With a style that captivates lovers of all music, the Canadian-bred San Francisco DJ has emerged as a frontrunner in the new wave of industry heavyweights. In a interview for MusicYouNeed.net, this stereophonic chameleon explains the method to his madness, “My goal is to make timeless bass music: I try to make every track an epic melodic adventure through many different genres.”With unabashed rebellion and seamless finesse, Stylust Beats captains this musical trip through uncharted waters on his new album, R.Y.F.S.O., released in Fall 2013 on the formidable bass label, Play Me Free Records. Weaving genres of trap, hip-hop, larger-than-life dubstep and sonic chill with stupefying synth work, R.Y.F.S.O. boasts a kaleidoscope of sound yet un-experienced in the market. Not far removed from his award-nominated Soundbwoy EP, Stylust is showing no sign of backing down from the innovative stylism that has earned him well over a million SoundCloud plays to date.Blending classic turntablism with cutting edge tech prowess, Geoff has been touring as DJ Stylust Beats since 2008. Stretching all over the United States, Canada and Costa Rica, he has headlined major festivals, including Shambala, Envision and Burning Man, to name a few. With the 2014 festival season already in full swing, this bass-slinging workhorse will be slaying dance floors across North America all summer long.Inspired by his older brother who was in a band, Stylust Beats began testing his musical mettle on the wheels of steel in 1998. His imaginative spins of counterintuitive genres were new territory back then, and he quickly gained fame as a fearless, party-rocking DJ reinventing the game. Within a couple of years, he took on the daunting challenge of producing and managing his own recording house, All-In Studios, which he ran successfully for ten years. This was the laboratory within which Stylust evolved from bass DJ to mad scientist, cutting his own brand of sonic mixology and perfecting his craft as prime-time producer.Sporting his first full-length album, R.Y.F.S.O., Stylust Beats is poised to rip the sleeves off the dubstep status quo, blazing a new trail of sound that will redefine the industry norms. But don’t be fooled by his rebel-without-a-care persona: with his own label, Sleeveless Records, Stylust is a consummate pro with a passion for his art form and global respect within his reach. Best described in his own words, just “Rip Yer F#*ckin’ Sleeves Off!”\nWith unabashed rebellion and seamless finesse, Stylust Beats captains this musical trip through uncharted waters on his new album, R.Y.F.S.O., released in Fall 2013 on the formidable bass label, Play Me Free Records. Weaving genres of trap, hip-hop, larger-than-life dubstep and sonic chill with stupefying synth work, R.Y.F.S.O. boasts a kaleidoscope of sound yet un-experienced in the market. Not far removed from his award-nominated Soundbwoy EP, Stylust is showing no sign of backing down from the innovative stylism that has earned him well over a million SoundCloud plays to date.\nBlending classic turntablism with cutting edge tech prowess, Geoff has been touring as DJ Stylust Beats since 2008. Stretching all over the United States, Canada and Costa Rica, he has headlined major festivals, including Shambala, Envision and Burning Man, to name a few. With the 2014 festival season already in full swing, this bass-slinging workhorse will be slaying dance floors across North America all summer long.\n\nInspired by his older brother who was in a band, Stylust Beats began testing his musical mettle on the wheels of steel in 1998. His imaginative spins of counterintuitive genres were new territory back then, and he quickly gained fame as a fearless, party-rocking DJ reinventing the game. Within a couple of years, he took on the daunting challenge of producing and managing his own recording house, All-In Studios, which he ran successfully for ten years. This was the laboratory within which Stylust evolved from bass DJ to mad scientist, cutting his own brand of sonic mixology and perfecting his craft as prime-time producer.\n\nSporting his first full-length album, R.Y.F.S.O., Stylust Beats is poised to rip the sleeves off the dubstep status quo, blazing a new trail of sound that will redefine the industry norms. But don’t be fooled by his rebel-without-a-care persona: with his own label, Sleeveless Records, Stylust is a consummate pro with a passion for his art form and global respect within his reach.

        "description": "You're invited to join Jeff Gaffner, owner and winemaker of Saxon Brown Wines, for and evening of food, wine and fun on Tuesday July 26th at 6pm.\n\nJeff began his winemaking career over 20 years ago with the famed Chateau St. Jean Winery in Sonoma. During his time with them, he was part of the winemaking team that produced the 1996 \"Cinq Cepages\", winner of Wine Spectator Magazine's 1999 Wine of the Year award.\n\nIn 1997, Jeff founded Saxon Brown to make wines from the very special vineyards he'd come to know in the Sonoma AVA. His wines include scintillating chardonnay and semillon, silky smooth pinot noir and classic Sonoma zinfandel. Production of each of Jeff's fine wines is very limited, usually only 200-300 cases per vintage. This is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy exclusive wines and chat with the always entertaining winemaker himself.\n\nJeff, our chefs and our sommelier have designed a sumptuous menu for your enjoyment. Each of the five courses will be paired with a remarkable Saxon Brown wine that is sure to please. All inclusive $75 per guest includes all 5 courses, tax and a 15% gratuity.\n\nWelcome Course:\n\n2012 Fighting Brothers Semillon\n\nSmoked Tuna Tostada\n\nFirst Course:\n\n2012 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay, Sonoma\n\n2012 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay, Carneros\n\nButter Poached Lobster / Foraged Greens / Citrus / Crispy Quinoa\n\nSecond Course:\n\n2012 Sangiacomo Vineyard Roberts Road Block Pinot Noir\n\nCedar Planked Duck Confit / Grilled Peach / Mustard Greens\n\n Third Course:\n\n2009 Parmalee Hill Owl Box Syrah\n\nElk Striploin / Boysenberry Reduction / Sweet Potato Puree / Wild Arugula / Goat Cheese\n\n Dessert Course:\n\n2007 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon\n\nCocoa Nib Coffee Beignets / Boysenberry Gelato / Mocha Sauce\n",

        "description": "Did you miss us? Well we're back again! Join us on Friday, November 4th for more DRUNKRESTO!\n\n******Has the lack of drunken actors performing in classic restoration comedies been leaving a hole in your life? Well never fear, because Random Access Theatre is happy to announce that we will be presenting a THREE MONTH EXTENSION run of DRUNK RESTORATION COMEDY!\n\nStarting FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7TH, we're back, taking over The Player's Theatre Loft on the first Friday of each month at 10PM for some more uproarious old-fashioned fun. In case you missed the first edition back in September here's how it goes down. The premise: our team of brave (or just crazy?) artistic associate actors will perform a reading of a restoration comedy. The catch: they'll be doing so while heavily under the influence. Even better, this interactive evening will give audience members a chance to choose their own adventure and dictate which performers get totally sloshed and which are sent packing. Anything could happen, come find out what does!\n\nTickets are only $12 and include a complimentary drink*- beer, wine, or craft cocktail, which means one less drink that YOU have to purchase for the fun drinking games we have up our sleeve! Buy your tickets online here, we can't wait to spend our Friday nights getting drunk and doing theatre with you!\n\nLine up of shows:\n\n\n\tDecember: A Christmas Carol\n\tJanuary: The Country Wife, by William Wycherley\n\n\t*Fear not - there's plenty of liquid courage to go around. Drinks will be available throughout the performance. Each general admission ticket includes one complimentary beverage, event is 21+\n",

When Tabitha returns “home” after a separation from her boyfriend, Stephen, what they've been missing becomes opaquely clear and who they're becoming makes it hard for them to see each other.

        "description": "Presented in 35mm!\"The cohesiveness between the film's story and the style of its telling is remarkable and announces Hauck as an emerging talent.\" –  Mark Olsen, Los Angeles TimesPrivate investigator Mel Sampson (Academy Award nominee John Hawkes) is tasked with tracking down the whereabouts of a missing woman from his own past.  With this familiar setup, TOO LATE takes the spine of the classic private eye genre and tears it to pieces, weaving it back together into a tapestry of southern California and the menagerie of eccentric personalities and lost souls who inhabit it. From the desolate, overgrown Radio Hill to the ritzy penthouse of The Beverly Hilton, the film presents a sprawling view of Los Angeles that ranges from the undiscovered to the iconic.  Filmed in the 35mm Techniscope format, the story of TOO LATE unfolds across five acts, each comprised of a single 20-plus minute uncut shot – roughly the same length as an entire projected film reel – making TOO LATE the perfect vehicle for a 35mm exhibition resurgence.Written and directed by Dennis Hauck, and featuring an ensemble cast that includes Crystal Reed, Dash Mihok, Rider Strong, Helen Sadler, John Hawkes, Brett Jacobson, Christopher K. Johnson, Vail Bloom, Jeff Fahey, Robert Forster, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, and Dichen Lachman, TOO LATE tells the story of a missing woman, but paints the portrait of a lost man.Official Selection: LA Film Festival, Fantastic Fest, Beyond Fest, Raindance Film Festival, Oldenburg Film Festival, Hells Half Mile Film &amp; Music FestivalFor more information visit: www.TooLateMovie.com",

        "title": "Son of Saul",
        "description": "The debut feature by László Nemes is an absolutely outstanding depiction of a death camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944. The film follows a prisoner named Saul (Röhrig), a man who works in the camp in the industrial process of body disposal. He is a member of the Sonderkommando, which is a group of prisoners given humiliating tasks, with minor increases in food ration in return for them carrying bodies from the gas chambers to pyres to be burned, and then dumping the ashes. While working Saul finds the body of his son, and begins a search to find a rabbi in order to secretly give his son the burial he deserves.Son of Saul is a harrowing, heartbreaking film that is incredibly well acted by the entire cast, with specific kudos to Rörig’s pained depiction of Saul. This is a very intense dramatic watch, but it is so profoundly human that it is not to be missed.",

WONG JINGCAST: Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Jackie Cheung, Simon Yam, Ekin Cheng, Chingmy Yau &amp; Dickey Cheung\"The best adaptation of Street Fighter to date.... Like taking the Hong Kong equivalent of the cast of Ocean's 11 and placing them in SUPER SMASH BROTHERS!\" - TarsTarkas.net\"In terms of visual dementia, Future Cops is utterly satisfying.\" - Richard Scheib, Moria.co.nzA team of hoverboard riding, laser-blasting Future Cops (comprised of three of the four Heavenly Kings of Canto-Pop Andy Lau, Jackie Cheung &amp; Aaron Kwok) are sent to the past to protect a clutzy high school student (the memorably named Dicky Leung) who will soon grow up to be a formidable Future Judge. It’s a wild tale in which faces get smashed, hearts get broken and it VERY unofficially features a bunch of video game characters. If you have ever wished The Terminator was about Street Fighter 2 characters in a high school comedy, then you're probably writer/director Wong Jing, guilty of some of the most entertainingly trashy Hong Kong films to ever attack an audience’s eyeballs, and host to that special brand of eccentric madness that we at The Laser Blast Film Society love to celebrate. The story goes that Mr. Wong sought the rights to adapt the popular videogame Street Fighter 2, was denied (probably because Campcom read his script), and then went ahead with his production anyway, slyly changing all the characters names (Guile becomes Broom-Man, Honda becomes Toyata), but preserving their costumes and even their patented special moves! The end result ricochetes between nonsense comedy in the vein of Stephen Chow (complete with an easter-egg cameo from the comedian), an insane wire-fu beat ‘em up and even a romantic comedy subplot that features a meet-cute set in the world of the Super Mario Bros. Bless you Wong Jing; you crazy, crazy man. (Justin Decloux)Tickets are $10! ($8 if you snap them up online!)WONG JING TRIBUTE PRE-SHOW STARTS AT 7:30 PMFEATURE STARTS AT 8 PM",

When you are no longer held back from love by old disappointments,  doubts, and fears, your whole life begins to crackle and sparkle with  new energy. When you come face to face with the truth of who you really  are—someone infinitely worthy of love and destined for it—you begin to  breathe more deeply than ever before.You become a magnet—unable  to push away the closeness, tenderness, and intimate connection that  WILL transform every part of your life. Physical health, emotional  well-being, work, finances, family, creative self-expression, life  purpose—all of these areas and more are infused with new vision and  possibility.In a container of great safety, warmth, and humor,  join renowned energy intuitive and relationship mentor Lee Harris, along  with his extraordinary co-facilitators, for a weekend of unexpected and  unimagined magic and change.  WHO THIS WORKSHOP IS FOR…  Whether you are single, in the developmental stages of a relationship,  in a long-term partnership, seeking to bridge the divide in a  relationship, or at any other place along the path of loving, this  workshop will offer uplifting new insights, powerful communication  skills, and the warming light of hope cast over all your relations.  For those already familiar with Lee’s Energy Mastery Retreats,  Revolutionary Love represents the evolution of that profound body of  work—energy mastery applied to loving others and oneself. \nHighlights of the process include:\n\nThe 3 keys to life-changing intimacy — mastering communication, boundaries, and the art of openness\n\nThe gift of conflict — learning how to break through rather than blow up\n\nThe energy of sex — opening to the joy and empowerment of the erotic force.Special note:  We will be approaching this topic from an energetic and emotional  understanding, and with the utmost care, safety, and respect for the  boundaries of each individual and the group as a whole. There will be no  nudity or sexually explicit exercises.\n\n\nThe miracle of self-love — discovering the healing power of being enough\n\nLearn  how to transform the inverted energies that keep relationship patterns  in place. If there is a past relationship you can't get over; a fear  that blocks you from taking risks in love; or shame and self-judgment  that hold you back, deep relief and freedom are your next destination  points along the journey.LEE HARRISLee  Harris is a gifted energy intuitive, author, and teacher. Leading a  vibrant online community, Lee reaches over 100,000 people around the  planet every month. His monthly Energy Forecasts, broadcast on YouTube,  have received over 2 million views to date and offer practical guidance  for navigating daily life with clarity and optimism.

DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\n\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\n\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n",

MacDonaldMore information about this film &amp; event on: The Screening Room's website.ABOUT THE FILM:DocumentaryRunning time: 90 minutesCanadaRated NR (not rated)Produced by Peter Raymont, Nancy Lang and Phyllis EllisDirected by Phyllis EllisFrom the producers of West Wind: The Vision of Tom Thompson.Synopsis:  One would think The Group of Seven needs no introduction. One hundred years since the creation of Canada’s most iconic paintings, through their works have been seen by millions, little is known about the artists themselves. Why did they choose locations in the remote, rugged wilderness of northern Ontario? Does anyone know precisely where they went?Past meets present creating a film that is evocative in approach, energized by breathtaking cinematography and sound design and offers a new and articulate voice to the artists who were the Group of Seven. Their journey informs our story throughout the film.Painted Land weaves seamlessly the experiences and history of these artists – Lawren Harris, J.E.H. MacDonald, AY Jackson, Frank Johnston, Arthur Lismer, Franklin Carmichael and AJ Casson – with the adventures of three modern day sleuths, historian Michael Burtch, and the writer and photographer team of Gary and Joanie McGuffin, who are determined to track down the precise locations of these famous paintings.Archival film, letters, journals and photographs of the artists – some of which have never been seen in public – take the viewers back in time. Stunning cinematography woven together with the artist’s paintings takes viewers up mountains, down canyons, to rivers and over portages with our trio, as they try to achieve their own personal quest: to actually ‘walk in the artist’s footsteps’? “A must for Group of Seven fans, and a true eye-opener for those who only know a few of the gang’s iconic Canadian paintings” -The Georgia Straight\n",

Now Ms. Rothauser brings her hilarious insight, along with her critically lauded voice, in an original production LIFE! WHO KNEW? to South Florida at The Palm Beaches Theatre.

Join her on the hilarious and inspiring musical transformation from Broadway performer to Stepford wife and back again.

        "description": "Lecture and Book Signing by Noted Analyst and Author James Hollis, PhDOur ancestors believed in ghosts, and perhaps they were not far off the mark as so much of daily life is driven by invisible psychic forces, archaic agendas, and imperious admonitions and prohibitions, all the more powerful because they operate unconsciously.  What are the features of such “hauntings,” and how might we gain some further foothold on a more conscious conduct of life?The lecture will explore the concept of personal hauntings. The role of the unconscious in the conduct of daily life will be examined. The significance of “complex” theory as a useful tool for self-examination and psychotherapy will be presented and means of identifying complexes through dream work and pattern analysis discussed. We will work towards enlarging participants’ sense of the many arenas in which energies and concomitant messages from the past direct and contaminate present choices.James Hollis, PhD, is a Jungian analyst, Executive Director of the Jung Society of Washington, and a co-founder of the Philadelphia Jung Institute.  He has written 14 books which are translated into 19 foreign languages.  He is a retired Professor of Humanitites, and presently a Professor of Jungian Psychology for Saybrook Graduate School of San Francisco.

        "description": "NOTE: THIS EVENT PAGE HAS BEEN CREATED TO GET THE WORD OUT. NO TICKETS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND THIS EVENT. ENTRANCE TO THE VENUE WILL BE ON A FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVE BASIS. IT DOES HELP IF YOU \"BUY\" A TICKET THOUGH SO WE CAN ANTICIPATE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ATTENDING.The Tri-City Freethinkers present David Silverman, the firebrand president of American Atheists and one of the best-known atheists in America. Known as \"America's loudest heathen,\" a term he embraces proudly, Silverman is passionate about atheism and atheist equality. He has appeared on several TV programs for on-air debates, including, The O'Reilly Factor, Hannity &amp; Colmes, Scarborough Country, and CNN's Paula Zahn NOW. He lives in New Jersey with his wife and child. His first book, Fighting God: An Atheist Manifesto for a Religious World, will be available in December of this year.Silverman was raised Jewish and went through the standard religious education, but never believed. In college, he engaged in many debates with Orthodox Jews, but, since Silverman's style is fierce but not insulting, he became very good friends with many of his opponents, eventually marrying one of them.Across the Internet and on TV, Silverman has been called rude, uncaring, and fascist (the latter by Bill O'Reilly), but the readers of Fighting God will realize he is none of those things. His methods ruffle feathers, but they work, and they work for the good of all people (except those who make money with religion). As Silverman's Jewish mother told him on her death bed, he not only helps atheists, but every person in any religious minority, because in the end, he fights only for the equality that is due all of us.Today, after nearly 20 years in activism, Silverman is arguably America's best-known atheist activist. In Fighting God, Silverman lays out why telling people God doesn't exist and religion is a lie is not only effective, but downright nice.",

His compositions provide melody interspersed with moments of dazzling virtuosity and creative drive. The current group includes:Jon Lloyd – soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, composition. I have played on the UK jazz and improvised music scene for over 20 years, playing with the likes of Paul Rogers, Mark Sanders, Marcio Mattos, Paul Clarvis, Stan Adler, Michel Pilz and Gerry Hemingway. John Law - Pianist has been a key member of my groups since the Jon Lloyd Quartet’s Syzygy backin 1991. He is a musician with a rare sensitivity and a fearless ability which cuts across all genres; his own musical path has connected freedom, classical music and jazz , reaching a high in recent years with his Congregation Trio with Asaf and Yuri Goloubev. He has also appeared for BJazz in his own right.Rob Palmer - Guitarist plays with a powerful soloing style coupled with a high regard for texture and ambient sound. He plays with saxophonist Theo Travis, vibes player Roger Beaujolais and French composer Daniel Biro.Tom Farmer - Bassist is part of the new generation of highly accomplished UK jazz musicians – a bandleader with the phenomenal Empirical and a bass player of enormous strength.Dave Hamblett - Drummer is one of the most in-demand young drummers on the UK scene. His style is rooted in the jazz tradition but is very much modern, encompassing influences from many different styles of music. His distinctive yet adaptable playing has lead him to work with many of the country’s finest musicians and play in a wide range of musical situations.The personnel will be: me on soprano saxophone, John Law on piano and keyboards, Rob Palmer on electric guitar, Tom Farmer on double bass and Dave Hamblett on drums.“…this is definitely a group to catch is you can.” John Lyons, Jazz UK.“A saxophone delivery as persuasive as a speaking voice. Lloyd should be seen and heard more often.” Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD“Ambitious and virtuosic...one of the most striking writers at the sharp end of British jazz and improvisation” John Fordham, The Guardian, UKThe personnel will be: John Lloyd soprano saxophone, John Law keyboards, Rob Palmerelectric guitar, Tom Farmer bass and Dave Hamblett on drums.",

Pitting grand landscapes against dinners of fried chicken and the roar of v8 engines on Saturday nights, the film wanders through Solitaire games (always won), secrets lost in cavernous hearts, and the fifty miles of bad road that always gets you home.USARunning Time: 72World PremiereDirector(s): Britni WestScreenwriter(s): Britni West, Poetry by Paul DickinsonProducer(s): Britni WestCast: Liz Randall, Paul Dickinson, Hillary Berg, RainLeigh Vick, Alex Karpovsky, Charles Smith, Nicholas StocktonProgrammer's Notes:Tired Moonlight is a love letter to small town Americana oblivious to Facebook, reality tv and diet soda. Like a Bob Dylan song come to life, Britni West’s poetic debut marries lush Montana imagery with endearing characters that society has largely ignored, but viewers won’t soon forget. Every face in this film tells a different story, be it foolish dreams, unrequited love or childhood wonder. Gorgeously shot on 16mm and evoking the grainy naturalism of a Maysles brothers’ documentary, Tired Moonlight casts a spell and doesn’t let go until you can smell the fireworks lighting up the summer nighttime sky. - Josh Mandel, ProgrammerPlaying with short film:DramaA young couple who are going to have sex in a car but realize that there are no more condoms left. When they see a young woman standing at the corner of an intersection, the girl in the car believes the young lady is a prostitute, and asks the guy to ask her for a condom. The guy hesitates to go because he thinks the lady is not, and he doesn't want to be awkward.

And if you don’t, well, then you’re just a full-on Monet. Ugh. At some point or another, we’ve all wished for a closet like Cher’s, or a love like Dionne and Murray’s, or someone to “rollin’ with the homies” with at a party. With Clueless, writer/director Amy Heckerling took the teen-movie genre and turned it completely on its head by creating a film that was funny, clever and sexy—with a few life lessons tossed in for good measure (like when a boy comes over you should totally have something baking). Also, Paul Rudd. 2015 marks the 20th anniversary of this iconic film so grab a mini dress (one Calvin Klein would approve of) and join us in getting a head-start on the celebration at the second monthly MUFF Society screening.The Monthly Underground Female Film Society (or MUFF Society for short) is a film series + community that aims to celebrate and champion all facets of women in film.

Ce « don » le met mal à l'aise mais, après l'avoir utilisé pour sauver un garçon qu'il avait renversé à moto, le monde de Fredi bascule. Bien que cette guérison miraculeuse atténue sa culpabilité concernant l'accident, elle commence aussi à changer sa vie et son entourage. Et, quand se répand la nouvelle de ses pouvoirs de guérisseur, les choses deviennent de plus en plus bizarres. Basé sur un roman du réalisateur François Dupeyron (dont les autres films comprennent MONSIEUR IBRAHIM), MON AME PAR TOI GUERIE est l'étude fascinante et émouvante du caractère d'un homme à fois doué et imparfait. Sous-titres en anglais.Awkward and middle-aged Fredi (brilliantly played by Gregory Gadebois), whose mother has recently passed away, discovers that he has his inherited her powers as a faith healer. He’s not at all comfortable with this “gift” of her healing hands, but after he accidentally runs over a boy with his motorcycle and then uses the gift to save him, Fredi’s world is transformed. While this miracle cure soothes Fredi’s guilt about the accident, it also begins to change his life and the people around him. When knowledge of Fredi’s healing powers becomes widespread, things become stranger and stranger. Based on a novel by multi-talented director François Dupeyron (whose other films include MONSIEUR IBRAHIM), ONE is a fascinating and moving character study of a man who is at once gifted and flawed.

All artists have the same problems that they must work through with differences in their interests and the order of importance that they give to various elements. He has said; “Drawing is the primary means the artist has to communicating his thinking, and figure drawing has been the measure of an artist’s skill since the caveman. As a drawing instructor I am dedicated to developing the student’s capabilities to communicate visually to their fullest extent. The bedrock of drawing the figure is the ability to draw the figure in any position from memory.”",

While our events are women focused, our networking series  attracts both men and women to connect.\n\nSignature Networking Events occur the first Thursday of every month. Sign up for the Women Grow newsletter for the most up-to-date information on chapter and national events.\n\n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nWho attends? You'll meet women (and men) at all different\n\nstages of their career in the cannabis industry. Many will be in the research phase, just learning more about opportunities, while still working day jobs. Some are looking for jobs with existing organizations. Others are starting up their own cannabis venture or ancillary business. Depending on the status of legalization in your state, you'll also meet cannabis business owners &amp; investors who are well on their way. Watch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend? Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members. Together we have more power. As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events? We recommend bringing business cards and a pen to take notes. If you don't have business cards, check out Moo for 10% off your first order (and your first order supports Women Grow). Watch our video on networking tips from Women Grow founding members.\n\nWhere are there Women Grow events? Women Grow events are held in small towns and large cities, in prohibition and legalized states alike. No matter where your county is on the road to legalization, you can have a Women Grow chapter. Learn more about starting a Women Grow Chapter.\n\nAre there ID requirements to attend? All attendees must be 21 years or older and have a valid ID as many events occur in establishments serving alcohol.\n\nWhat are my transportation/parking options? We recommend taking public transportation. Street parking is not guaranteed, plan accordingly.\n\nCan I pay at the door? Paying in advance helps speed up our check-in process and makes sure you receive all event announcements. If you are unable to pay in advance, please bring cash.\n\nAre tickets refundable or transferrable? You may send a friend to attend in your place. Tickets are not refundable.\n\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No, as long as your ID matches the name your registered the ticket under. You may also show us your ticket on your mobile device. If you are giving your ticket to a colleague, please forward them the ticket to show us.\n\nAre events on different days other than the first Thursday of the month? Women Grow networking events are on the first Thursday of each month (except for holiday weeks). Social events can be planned at other times. Women Grow's national events are held a few times a year. Make sure you're on the Women Grow mailing list to receive invitations.\n\nWhy do you charge for events? Women Grow is funded by event proceeds and sponsors. We charge for our events so that Women Grow is a self-sustaining organization. If you are unable to afford an event, please contact the organizer to ask about volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy should I consider a career in the cannabis industry? Watch our videos on getting started in the cannabis industry and why women should get involved.\n\nTWITTER TIPS\n\nA great way to connect with fellow participants is to use common hashtags when tweeting about the event. You can use the same hashtags on Facebook. Photos rock. Please share them if you take any!\n\n#WomenGrow #cannabis #womenincannabis #mmj #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis\n",

He restores hope, and takes away the fear of change at a time when it is so crucial that we do so.”   - Jean Gelwicks\n\nWhile acknowledging the various crises we face - climate, energy, ecosystem, economy, housing, democracy, social,... we must be able to imagine a future that is beautiful, green and sustainable. This presentation was recorded at the launch of his new book. He lays out the big picture, and shares the vision of a future brimming with innovation and hope, where the climate crisis is being tackled, the solar revolution is underway, and a new economy is taking shape. Green energy is an essential piece of this future.\n\nGuy Dauncey is an author, organizer and sustainable communities’ consultant who specializes in developing a positive vision of a post-industrial, environmentally sustainable future, and translating that vision into action.\n\n Visit a local home where a ground source heat pump has been installed  (geothermal)\n\nSaturday, September 10, 12:15 pm - 1:15 pm\n\n 557 Indian Grove\n\n Right after the screening and discussion of Journey to the Future, we will walk over, some 6 blocks, to 557 Indian Grove, and visit this local home where a ground source heat pump has been installed. This modest 1890s rowhouse has been using a ground source heat pump system (or geothermal) for heating and cooling since 2011. This home uses a vertical closed loop system installed in the 16 ft. wide backyard. It has worked flawlessly, significantly increased the home comfort, and lowered energy bills. Gas was removed from the residence at the same time, and the owner used induction hot plates for cooking, along with a large toaster oven for baking. New fibreglass windows and closed cell foam insulation was also installed in the residence the same year. Plaster lime walls are in the process of being restored.\n\n About geothermal systems:\n\nA ground source heat pump system - or geothermal system - takes heat from the ground in winter (for heating), and transfers heat back into the ground in the summer (for cooling).\n\nMore information on heat pumps:\n\nhttp://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/publications/efficiency/heating-heat-pump/6833\n",

It’s a punishing profession unlike any other, holding little mercy for its candidates on or off the ice.  Born out of self policing a game where 200 pound men fly towards each other on metal blades with sticks, the role now finds itself facing the scrutiny of national newspapers, on-line blogs and TV news casts.  Due to its violent nature, it has drawn opinions from both fans and critics alike.  \n\nBut what do we really know?  What led to its spectacular rise?  What purpose does it serve in the eyes of its beholders and what drives them forward in the face of adversity?  Ice Guardians steps beyond the hype and heads directly to the source of the debate… the players themselves.  Through their eyes, tough exteriors are shed to reveal the humanity behind a role that struggles to maintain its existence. \n",

Many visitors, after driving through hours of parched desert and miles of treeless farmland, are astounded to find this beautiful urban forest, right in the middle of town.\n\nHow did these trees get here? How old are they, and what species are they? How can we help to continue this legacy? Our resident tree expert, Bob Berger, will answer these questions and many more.\n\nStarting at the Whitman College campus, and winding through town to Pioneer Park, Bob will lead a two-mile stroll through town.  On the way, you’ll discover that 44 of Walla Walla’s trees are the largest known of their species in our state. They’re truly in the record books! He’ll also share with us great natural history, conservation information and the historical significance of these treasures.\n\nRefreshments and drinks will be served after the tour ends in Pioneer Park. Bring family and friends, and a notebook to record all that you learn. Receive a map of all the record trees in town, and gain a deep appreciation of the foresight our city residents had over 100 years ago to create the amazing forest we now call home.\n",

It means we are actively interested in the well-being of our employees and of our community,” said Darcey, the winery’s general manager.\n\nCome share some time with these Walla Walla wine pioneers and learn the basics of their craft.  Tour the production area and enjoy some time in their tasting room if you like.  Walk through a vineyard and hear about the tending of the vines.  Hear about their sustainable practices employed from vineyard to bottling to sales and beyond. Wine tastings are available to adults for $5.\n\nBring a sack lunch, if you wish, and enjoy a picnic on the winery's grounds with other guests after the tour.\n\nMust be 21 and older to attend this event.\n",

        "description": "August 12, The Appice Brothers takeover Sharkey's Summer Stage with a larger than life rock performance.\n\nThe Appice Brothers, Carmine and Vinny, have conquered the rock world for decades and now join forces to conquer the world with their own rock show. Playing the greatest hits of their previous bands like Black Sabbath, Dio, Ozzy Osbourne, Rod Stewart, Blue Murder and more, the Appice Brothers deliver a rock show that will impress both rockers and drummers alike. This show is not a drum show but a high energy, mind blowing rock concert with legendary songs, played with vehemence &amp; power. Legendary rock drummer, Carmine Appice (Ozzy Osbourne, Rod Stewart, Vanilla Fudge, Cactus, and Jeff Beck to name a few), has enjoyed an amazing almost 50 year career as a rock star, music educator, author, and rock pioneer. He is widely considered to be one of the most accomplished showmen in rock.Carmine is the recipient of numerous awards including Modern Drummer Hall of Fame, Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame, and dozens of gold and platinum selling records. Carmine co-wrote such monster selling hits as \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\" and \"Young Turks\". He has broken new ground in every aspect of his career. As a performer, as a teacher, and as a writer, he continues to inspire drummers and listeners throughout the world with his originality and his unwavering dedication to the art of drumming. In 2016, Carmine unleashed his book titled “STICK IT - My Life of SEX, DRUMS, AND ROCK ‘N’ ROLL”.Vinny Appice’s unique, powerful drumming is marked not by his performances with a single group, but by his flawless musical contributions and drumming to an extensive list of rock and roll icons like Black Sabbath, Ronnie James Dio, Heaven &amp; Hell, Rick Derringer, John Lennon and more!  A consummate performer and drummer, Vinny is also a brilliant clinician, performing clinics and master classes all across the globe, as well as making appearances in films and television. Vinny can be heard on Rock Classic albums like Black Sabbath's \"Mob Rules\" and Dio's \"Holy Diver\" &amp; \"Last in Line\".\n",

        "description": "Abounding Prosperity, Inc. (AP, Inc.) is proud to host the 5th annual, Southern Regional Ball/House and Pageant (B/HAP) Communities’ Leadership and Health Disparities Conference (now known throughout the country simply as “B/HAP”). B/HAP convenes each year during the first weekend of October in Dallas, Texas. Meeting dates for the 2015 B/HAP are from Thursday, September 29th to Saturday, October 1st.\n\nThe overall goal of the B/HAP Conference is to reduce health disparities across the southern region of the United States by promoting health equity and improving leadership capacity among sexual minorities and members of the GLBT community. The Southern Region of the United States has felt the devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and among localities listed in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy’s 12 Cities Project, a White House initiative created to eliminate the burden of AIDS in jurisdictions most affected, the primary conference target audience includes members, patrons, spectators and allies of the House Ball Community in the southern region of the US These states include Alabama, Arkansas, DC, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. We also have invited researchers, reproductive and sexual health educator prevention specialists, medical professionals, local, state and federal health officers, health policy makers and elected officials.\n\nAs we prepare for our 5th Annual Conference, we have chosen the theme: “ALL Black Life Matters! Joining the Fight to Shatter Silence and Destroy Disparities—B/HAP Communities on the Move! ” to underscore public knowledge of disproportionate, health outcomes like new incidences of HIV/AIDS which target poor, people of color and how B/HAP communities are contributing effective leadership to lessening such disparities. In addition to the benefits of focusing on promoting the grass-roots “voice” and an organic leadership “presence” from within B/HAP communities, the 2016 conference also will promote those businesses that want to earn more significant, market shares and customers’ brand loyalty from the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender (GLBT) communities of color, especially those GLBT of color who will participate in Dallas Southern Pride, the weekend entertainment venue concurrent with the B/HAP Conference every year.\n\nAP, Inc. will host the B/HAP Conference which will target African American and Latino men who have sex with men (AAMSM/LMSM) as well as Transgender male-to-female (T-MTF) individuals. All of these persons are members, fans, supporters, allies and/or spectators of Ball/House and Pageant (B/HAP) communities. The B/HAP Conference will enable Abounding Prosperity to continue to serve educational needs within these African American and Latino MSM populations, but an intentional focus of the B/HAP Conference is on young MSM/T-MTF who compete within the Ball/House and Pageant (B/HAP) communities and who also may be attending Dallas Southern Pride, an annual event planned by AP, Inc. in conjunction with the B/HAP Conference.\n\nFor additional information about the B/HAP Conference, Southern Pride events, or the efforts of AP, Inc., please feel free to contact us by phone 214-421-4800 or email info@bhapconference.org.\n",

Ask about our discount pricing for U.S. military veterans.\n\nLIKE us on Facebook: www.Facebook.com/NYSafetyandTraining\n\nVisit our website: www.NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings mandates that all workers at major construction sites must have had the OSHA 10-hour Construction Industry safety class within the last five years. DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\n\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\n\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n",

        "description": "The Coconut Club is a whimsical culinary and mixology adventure inspired by the exotic flair of a Tiki bar, seeking to elevate the tenets of Tiki through a thoughtfully presented evening of imaginative cocktails paired with delicious food.\n\nTiki isn’t just about crazy cocktails and whimsical cuisine, it’s about taking all of its elements–the lure of the islands, the romance of the exotic, an escape into a world of mystery and adventure– and creating an experience inspired by the past but always pushing forward. For whatever reason, the Tiki phenomenon kind of stopped dead in its tracks sometime during the 70s. Sad but true. Since then, it’s been living in the past, spinning its wheels, asleep in the cabana, and churning out the same-old same-old. And while Tiki “same-old same -old” is more exciting than most, the potential to push it into an even bolder and more over-the-top direction is limitless.\n\nThe Coconut Club is not a restaurant, but rather a supper club experience.  We pop-up at various locations for short-run exclusive events.\n",

The band’s captivating blend of indie rock, pop and country elements is more vivid, fine-tuned, and addictive than ever before. Vocalist/guitarist Evan Stephens Hall along with brothers Zack Levine (drums) and Nick Levine (guitar) form a core that has been playing together since early childhood. Painting his emotions onto these songs with colorful and kinetic strokes, Hall moves through Cardinal’s eight songs with unforgettable energy and passion, with a vocal performance that is pleasantly reminiscent of Will Oldham and Built to Spill’s Doug Martsch. Highlighted by the downtrodden nostalgia of twangy opener “Old Friends” and the climactic refrain of “Size of the Moon,” where the confession “I don’t know what I’m afraid of,” is just as much of a sing-a-long as it is an emotional breakdown, moods don’t stay in one place for very long on Cardinal - they are carefully crafted and revisited throughout to continually evoke the album’s central themes of memory, language, and home.https://www.facebook.com/events/111055869301009/",

        "title": "Tale of Tales",
        "description": "Adapted from the works of poet Giambattista Basile, Tale of Tales expertly combines fantasy and horror to create a profoundly uncomfortable and yet remarkably compelling viewing experience. The movie follows three tales, La Cerva Fatata (The Enchanted Doe), La Pulce (The Flea) and La Vecchia Scorticata (The Flayed Old Lady), with artistic touches of other Basile tales woven in. Famous faces grace the screen throughout the three stories, such as Salma Hayek as a barren and heartbroken queen, who meets a necromancer that tells her how she can get pregnant, but it is an extremely risky spell to cast. Toby Jones stars in the second segment as a king in Highmountain who begins to take care of a friendly and fast-growing flea, and is faced with the task of finding a suitable husband for his daughter. In the last segment we see Vincent Cassel as a lustful king who becomes enticed by a woman who he has not seen, but only heard singing. He becomes hellbent on making her his queen, yet he has no idea that she is one of two very elderly sisters.  Tale of Tales is not only equipped with a perfect cast, but with such extravagant sets and the amazing use of practical effects for the film’s monsters, it is a captivating, and occasionally frightening movie. Blood, lust, ghouls and death hit the screen in this spell-binding flick from director Matteo Garrone.",

Recorded in the winter of 2015 in the dungeons of Kick's ancestral home, with nothing but their wits and the drunken advice of their old friend, Azul, Position is the result of their sweat, blood and angst. From slow and wicked to fast and heavy, No Thanks is the manic delivery of Castro Turf, the shrieking strings of Kick Banan, the furious rhythms of Ruby Roux, and the relentless percussions of the Lost Boy. Together the No Thanks Liberation Front cries out against the evils of social hierarchy, and calls upon an eager audience to liberate themselves from subjugation.\n\nHailing from Lincoln, Bien Fang delivers grunge, punk, and pop in riotous style, sure to awaken and empower those that listen to their haunting lyrics. None can deny the power, talent and righteousness prevalent in their set.\n\nClassic and sludgy the sounds of Super Moon leaves listeners in awe, as an atmosphere of doom envelopes them. The air trembles with their dark sounds, as black magic takes hold.\n\nTogether these three bands are sure to deliver a night for the witches, where black cats lurk under moonlight and rebellious freedom rings off of each musical note. Songs will be sung, bonds will be formed, and constrains will be broken.\n\nThere will be limited quantities of free pizza and root beer, so show up early! There is a solid chance of vegan options for pizza as well.\n\nFriday, June 17thMilk Run, 1907 Leavenworth9:30 p.m. show, $5 adv/do\n",

Kat and Arthur have left the academic realm in favor of assuming control of a family-owned funeral parlor, while Clara and Nicholas have gone the route of adjunct professors; all are haunted by their positions. Clara and Nicholas taunt Kat and Arthur for leaving academia while lamenting their own newly onset professorial malaise, and envying their backdoor exit, while Kat and Arthur savor their roles as ejected fools while aching somewhat for the self-satisfying virtues of an academic life.

        "description": "Emily Burnshttps://soundcloud.com/emilyburnsukEmily’s vocals have already drawn comparison to artists such as Alessia Cara, Nao, Jessie Ware and Tori Kelly and her unique R&amp;B Pop sound and stand out vocals are creating a strong industry buzz which reached fever pitch at a recent stand out performance at the Great Escape music festival. With imminent plans to independently release her debut single and embark on her debut UK tour, working with writers/producers including: Emre Ramazanoglu, Dan McDougall and Edd Holloway, Emily Burns is definitely one to watch this year. Emily will be supported by rising emerging artists: Matt Gresham and Jonny Stemp. Matt Greshamhttps://soundcloud.com/mattgreshamofficial   Lead single Small Voices, produced by Scott Horscroft (Silverchair,  Birds Of Tokyo) and written with Jaymes Young (London Grammar) is one  such example of Gresham expanding beyond his already popular aesthetic.  With a soulful tenor that bounds over his placid acoustic guitar,  Gresham is a favourite for laidback listeners raised (as he was) on the  sounds of everyone from Ben Harper to Paul Simon.  “The fondest  memories [I have] are hearing my mum sing and my brother play guitar at  some of our back yard jam sessions when I was about 13,” he reminisces.  “I was so attracted to the sound of an acoustic guitar and hearing my  brother play.”   As Gresham relocates temporarily to Los Angeles  to write with new collaborators and a run of US shows, there’s an ocean  of possibility before him. It’s the beginning of a new journey for the  one-time Western Australian surfer who has been independently recording,  touring and playing around Australia for nearly eight years.   “I try to stay open to genres and listen mostly to the writing and tones  of instruments,” says Gresham. “Small Voices is a song about a man in  jail missing his daughter, but I've also been thinking it could be about  someone trapped in a city life who wants to break out and live in the  forest.”   With an EP on its way and 'Small Voices' set to make  further waves for Gresham back home, it looks like 2016 is going to be a  big one.

The majority of the presenters residing in Canada who have also immigrated from elsewhere in the continent. About one-third are non-Latin filmmakers, academics, or both, whose work exhibits different foci and degrees of concern with border-crossing issues and post-national diasporic identity formations.In reflecting on the history, the panel aims to consider the framework evolution that will be needed to support Latin Canadian independent filmmaking into the future.  The question of the ongoing need for spaces for culturally specific media arts exhibition and their relevance to future generations of independent Latin-Canadian filmmakers is being questioned, and this question will serve as the starting point for discussion on this panel.Panelists include notable Latin American media artist and programmers such as Ricardo Acosta, Alejandro Ronceria, Jorge Lozano, and Sinara Rozo.With this special program we aim to showcase the achievements and talent of our filmmakers and their integral role in the artistic identity of the Canadian cultural panorama. ",

From bringing  photographs and paintings to life to making a paintbrush paint all by  itself, even the most jaded illusionists have declared Vitaly's show as  containing “some of the most incredible and impossible magic ever  witnessed.”An Evening Of Wonders also features Vitaly's famous  feat where he manages to make the photo from your driver's license  disappear. So, if you're brave enough to surrender your ID to him, you  will have to expect the unexpected.  What if when he made the photo come  back, it wasn't a picture of you, but of Marilyn Monroe or George  Clooney?  Is it magic or trickery?  The only way to be sure is to catch  one of Vitaly’s increasingly popular performances before all of the  tickets have disappeared into thin air.--Recommended for ages 8 and up.For more info see: http://www.EveningOfWonders.com",

A copy of SIGN O’ THE TIMES on Amazon is currently $460.Upon release, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that the Sign o’ the Times record is \"the most gifted pop musician of his generation proving what a motherfucker he is for two discs start to finish” — a fitting description for the eclectic 1987 record often ranked amongst the greatest albums of all time. He had equal enthusiasm for the film, considering it a worthy challenger to STOP MAKING SENSE for the title of greatest rock concert film ever made.The film also features the ridiculously stacked band that accompanied Prince on his 1987 Sign o' the Times Tour, including drummer Sheila E. and The Revolution’s keyboardist Dr. Fink.Head to The Royal early for a pre-show and love-in of Paisley Park’s The Purple One!

They had noticed that roughly 93% of Northern California Vineyard acreage was planted to only eight grape varieties- the remaining seven percent home to hundreds of lesser known varieties. Noting the dominance of the ”Big Eight” this small posse of friends set out to help highlight that seven percent of acreage, the varieties that are grown there, the folks who make wine from these varieties, and all the supporting efforts from winemakers and farmers made to shift these acreage percentages. The Seven % Solution Tasting Event is the result of these efforts.Seven % Solution headlines winemakers who champion these grapes, tend terroir, and produce wine that is slowly but surely shifting the perception of California wines toward varietal balance. We look for wines which show varietal balance. We look for wines that come from organic and biodynamic farming practices. We look for wines that presents indicators of climate and terroir. We are proud to support these individuals, winemakers and farmers alike, and to help bring these \"Seven % Solutions\" to a new cadre of wine connoisseur.",

In doing so, we are taking a portion of every ticket sale and proceeding it to the Big Brothers and Sisters Foundation. In addition to this we currently trying to support inner city public school by having students come and see how the set-up of a concert is done. We are going the lengths in doing this because we know the demographic of our concert is directly tied into the platform of Brothers and Sisters and can understand the lack of opportunities derived from an inner-city school. We see this as a win-win situation. ",

Failure to act responsibly and proactively could result in fines, imprisonment, and suspension of licenses, increased insurance costs, or getting shut down.\n\nCannabis Trainers invites savvy, professional operators to prepare their team to handle these potential risks with extensive, in depth training programs.\n\nMaureen McNamara is a Trainer, Facilitator and Coach. She has led hundreds of workshops and coaches business professionals and entrepreneurs to create more success and joy in their lives.\n\nWith 20+ years of professional training experience, Maureen has trained and certified 10,000+ employees, managers and owners in national certification programs.

With over twenty-five years of business, operations, human resources management training and experience, business leaders have appreciated my firsthand experience in operations, my understanding of how all the HR functions impact the bottom line, and the proper balance of employee and business needs.\n\nBefore focusing on HR, I established a solid track record as a successful business partner improving revenue generation and containing costs when working with start-ups and organizations undergoing explosive growth. I derived keen insights from my operational background enabling me to improve profitability through attention to return on investments, employee retention, improved organizational design and development, and aligning HR to organizational strategies and goals. My experience is largely based in retail, and other client or customer service industries, with exposure to mining and financial organizations. I have extensive experience in recruiting, training and facilitation, employee relations, negotiation and conflict resolution, talent management, leadership development and succession planning.\n\nRecently, I completed a Master’s Degree in Human Resources Management with a Specialization in Organizational Leadership and have successfully applied my knowledge in the latest trends affecting HR and business today – talent management, employee engagement, leadership development and organizational culture. I remain current through education and networking, in large part, from my involvement with the Mile High Society for Human Resource Management, the local chapter of the global association of SHRM, where I serve as Secretary/Treasurer on the Board of Directors.\n\nAs a lifelong learner, I share my knowledge of successes… and failures. As a risk taker, I share the benefits of diversity and change while overcoming associated challenges. As an optimist, I emphasize the positives while dealing with the negatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAELA BINTNER &amp; CHRIS CASSESE, CO-FOUNDERS AND MANAGING DIRECTORS - FACES \nTopic: Differences between HR and recruiting\n\n\nCaela Bintner brings more than two decades of communications, marketing and senior sales experience to Faces Human Capital Management (“Faces”), a Human Capital Management (HCM) company of which she is the co-founder.

Watch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend? Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members. Together we have more power. As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events?

A transcendent and deeply affecting new play, which shifts perfectly from hilarity to grief.\" —Entertainment Weekly. \"RABBIT HOLE presents a tragedy and its consequences with utter candor, and without sentimentality. The dialogue is most impressive for capturing the awkwardness and pain of thinking people faced with an unthinkable situation—and eventually, their capacity for survival, and even hope.\" —USA Today. Becca and Howie Corbett have everything a family could want, until a life-shattering accident turns their world upside down and leaves the couple drifting perilously apart. RABBIT HOLE charts their bittersweet search for comfort in the darkest of places and for a path that will lead them back into the light of day. (R, Drama)",

        "description": "“Fassbender was born for this.” -The TelegraphJustin Kurzel’s Macbeth is the latest fantastic adaptation of Shakespearean’s grittiest, and it is being cited as one of easily one of the best, due to the fantastic performances from Fassbender in the titular role and Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. Although the question “What more can you do with Macbeth after so many great directors have already touched it?” seems to be a natural query, Kurzel takes the already blood-soaked classic tale and digs deeper, creating a gruesomely dark, enthralling depiction of one of literature’s most ill-fated main characters. Justin Kurzel hits the screens like a bat out of hell, with his only previous feature being the brutal serial killer flick Snowtown, set in his hometown. This visceral viewing is as beautiful as it is dark, and deserves to be remembered in the annals of time as one of the necessary Shakespeare adaptations. ",

        "description": "Online ticket sales for tonight's presentation of On The Bride's Side have closed but there are still tickets available! Please purchase your ticket at the ByTowne Cinema box office at 325 Rideau Street. Note: The ByTowne Cinema only accepts cash, but there's an ATM there that you can use.Thank you to everyone who purchased a ticket in advance. We look forward to seeing you this evening!Join One World Arts and the One World Film Festival on January 28th, 2016 at 6:45PM at the ByTowne Cinema (325 Rideau St., Ottawa) for a one-night-only screening of the acclaimed documentary ON THE BRIDE'S SIDE.The film follows five asylum-seekers from Syria and their European supporters as they travel from Milan, Italy to Stockholm, Sweden over four days in a fake wedding party.\"More than a traditional documentary, On The Bride’s Side is a  statement   and an irreverent act of defiance on the part of a  seldom-heard  segment  of Europeans who feel the need to speak out  against immigration  laws  they deem unjust and arbitrary.\" Juan  Baquero, Hot DocsA discussion on responding to refugees fleeing the war in Syria will follow On The Bride's Side.Tickets are $12.00.  Media are invited to attend free of charge. Please RSVP to media[at]oneworldarts[dot]ca attend.ABOUT ON THE BRIDE'S SIDEA Palestinian poet and an Italian journalist meet five Palestinians and Syrians in Milan who entered Europe via the Italian island of Lampedusa after fleeing the war in Syria. They decide to help them complete their journey to Sweden – and hopefully avoid getting themselves arrested as traffickers – by faking a wedding. With a Palestinian friend dressed up as the bride and a dozen or so Italian and Syrian friends as wedding guests, they cross halfway over Europe on a four-day journey of three thousand kilometres. This emotionally charged journey not only brings out the stories and hopes and dreams of the five Palestinians and Syrians and their rather special traffickers, but also reveals an unknown side of Europe – a transnational, supportive and irreverent Europe that ridicules the laws and restrictions of the Fortress in a kind of masquerade which is no other than the direct filming of something that really took place on the road from Milan to Stockholm from the 14th to the 18th of November 2013.The One World Film Festival is Ottawa's longest-running annual documentary film festival focused on raising awareness on a diverse range of global issues. The festival presents thought-provoking documentaries, panel discussions with experts, Q&amp;As with filmmakers, and an information fair, connecting audiences with opportunities to learn more about and take action on issues of local and global concern.One World Arts is a volunteer-based, Canadian charitable organization that has been raising awareness and fostering public engagement on global issues since 1972.",

For large groups we suggest coming earlier in the day or during week days. Q: Does the surface skate like real ice?A: It won’t be made of ice. Instead, skaters will glide on top of a recyclable polymer surface made to look like ice. Skaters will wear real skates, but the surface won’t feel cold like traditional ice. The synthetic rink requires no electricity or refrigeration. To keep it slippery, the surface with be sprayed with a slide enhancer liquid that reduces the friction of skate blades. The surface will skate just slightly slower than real ice.Q: I pre-purchased a ticket, what do I do now?A: Bring your pre-purchased ticket or voucher to the Great Skate ticket booth which is located at the rink. Here you will exchange your ticket or voucher for an all day skating pass for that day. Q: Will there be food and beverage available for purchase?A: Yes. Enjoy a great menu of holiday food and beverage brought to you by the staff at the Courtyard Scottsdale Salt River. You can also venture into the Marriott Bistro to enjoy additional menu items.Q: Do I have to pre-purchase my tickets?A: It is suggested that tickets be purchased ahead of time, but not required. Pre-purchased tickets will be redeemed at the Great Skate for your all day pass. Q: Does the skate rental include socks?A: The Holiday Great Skate does not provide socks so please make sure to bring your own.Event Partners:",

Next to their camp is a small hut occupied by three cooks who work at a nearby restaurant. The cooks are looking for some meat to cook and there's no one around other than the young students. The film is based on a true story about a restaurant that served minced human flesh for food and is shot in a single take.Awards:Dubai International Film Festival 2013 - Muhr Asia-Africa Special Jury PrizeFribourg International Film Festival 2014 - FIPRESCI Prize and Youth Jury AwardVenice Film Festival 2013 - Venice Horizons Award - Special Prize13th Lisbon International Film Festival - Best Film award13th If Istanbul Independent Film Festival - Best Film AwardDirector's view: Fish and Cat is a film about time. It is about how to make a perspective within time, and thereby, unhinging time. What fascinated me about making this film was the style of its execution: the insistence on a fictional narrative style within the bounds of single shot and the attempt to create fissures in time during that single shot. I chose to tell a true story in this film, a true story which nevertheless, resembles a nightmare.The movie's language is Persian, with English subtitles. خلاصه فیلمنامه: چند دانشجوی دختر و پسر برای شرکت در جشن بادبادک بازی در شب یلدا به شمال رفته اند. در همسایگی کمپ کوچک آنها کلبه ای قرار دارد که سه آشپز یک رستوران ساکن آن هستند. آشپزها برای پخت غذا به گوشت احتیاج دارند و جز این جوانها کسی آن اطراف نیست ... قصه فیلم بر اساس یک داستان واقعی درباره رستورانی است که گوشت چرخ کرده انسان را پخت میکرده، و تمام فیلم در یک سکانس پلان اتفاق میافتد. دیدگاه کارگردان: ماهی وگربه فیلمی است درباره زمان. درباره اینکه چطور میتوان در زمان پرسپکتیو ایجاد کرد و آن را درهم ریخت. جذابیت ساخت این فیلم برایم در شیوه اجرایش بود. پافشاری بر روایت داستانی دریک سکانس پلان و تلاش برای اینکه در یک پلان که طبیعتا زمانی روبه جلو دارد شکست به وجودآورد. برای بستر چنین فیلمی، داستانی واقعی را انتخاب کردم، داستانی که شبیه یک کابوس به نظر میرسید.",

        "description": "Discover the joy of making sustainable, homemade food crafts. Learn hands-on how to create simple, yet sophisticated, artisanal edible gifts for your own pantry and your loved ones.Homemade food crafts, such as jared goods, culinary and medicinal herb mixes, flavored salts and sugars, infused oils, snacks, and dry food mixes, have been part of people’s pantries for millennia. As gifts, the love and effort that go into making them always enhanced their value in the community. Technological advancements and industrialization in food crafting made it easy for people to buy these goods for their pantries and gifts. In the process, the thoughtfulness, creativity, and human productivity attached to homemaking has become lost, and environmental degradation increased. Homemade artisanal food crafts replace the energy, water and natural resources wasted in big-commercial-industrial operations with human ingenuity, purposeful effort and love. A home food craft maker is a promoter and supporter of health, abundance and sustainability for all!Join Us to learn hands-on and enjoy the art and science behind artisanal food crafting. In this workshop we will: Learn hands-on how to use edible ingredients to create beautiful artisanal food crafts for your pantry and for gifting\nMake herb bundles, flavored salts and sugars, infused oils, simple syrups, heirloom dried soup mixes and more\nTaste a variety of artisanal food crafts\nEach participant will take home a personalized salt blend, herb bundle and choice of infused oil or simple syrup!Instructor: Chef Kerri CacciataInstructor Bio: Kerri was born and raised in Orange County. She earned her Bachelor’s degree in community organizing in San Francisco and studied culinary arts locally, finding harmony when the two subjects come together. She has worked in non-profit agencies, farmers markets, and in a number of professional kitchens. Kerri has spent over 10 years working and volunteering in the city of Santa Ana, and has worked hard to help bring a new farmers’ market to the community, launching the DTSA Certified Farmers' Market March 2014.In Southern California we’re blessed with a passionate group of farmers, artisan food crafters, and creative chefs.

The film features two parallel storylines with characters trapped in endless cycles: A police officer and two brothers find themselves stuck in a stairwell that keeps going up and down, while a family on a road trip plays a frightening game of “Are we there yet?” The repetitions are absurdly funny and horrifying alike. In between these stories are images of aging bride who rides an escalator around and around, much like the hamster who spins on a wheel and connects the fates of them all..Screens with: Odd One OutDir.

This year The Poetry Brothel's 8th annual Masquerade will be a whirling disco ball of costumed time travel with masked mavens of every epoch. Whether your midnight reverie is the Medico della Peste staring back at you from the obsidian surface of a Venetian canal, or the golden visage of Versailles twilight, it matters not; for The Madame's house is yours for the night. On October 25th the house will also belong to special guests Arielle Greenberg, The Hot Club of Flatbush, Foxx Von Tempt, Cassandra Rosebeetle, Matt Cooper, and more. So join us, loves, in love, not simple resignation to this most merry of occasions.ABOUT THE POETRY BROTHEL:The Poetry Brothel is a unique and immersive poetry event that takes poetry outside classrooms and lecture halls and places it in the lush interiors of a bordello. The Poetry Brothel presents a rotating cast of both male and female poets as “whores,” each operating within a carefully crafted character, who impart their work in public readings, spontaneous eruptions of poetry, and most distinctly, as purveyors of private poetry readings on beds, chaise lounges and in private rooms. For a small fee, all of the “poetry whores” are available for these sequestered readings at any time during the event. Of course, any true brothel need a good cover; The Poetry Brothel’s is an immersive cabaret, offering a full bar, musicians, burlesque dancers, painters, actors, and fortune-tellers, with newly integrated themes, performances and installations at each event.",

        "description": "BreatheNarrative Feature | 91 minutes | 2014 | FranceDirector: Melanie LaurentA taut, nuanced story about the depths of female friendships and the dark side of teenage infatuations, Breathe, the sophomore directorial effort from Melanie Laurent, is an assured adaptation of the sensational French young adult novel of the same name. Charlie (Josephine Japy) is seventeen and bored. Her estranged parents are too caught up in their own drama to pay her much attention. School holds no surprises either, and Charlie grows tired of her staid friends. Enter Sarah (Lou de Laege), a confident and charismatic new transfer student who brings with her an alluring air of boldness and danger. The two form an instant connection, and through shared secrets, love interests and holiday getaways their relationship deepens to levels of unspoken intimacy. But with this intimacy comes jealousy and unrealistic expectations, and soon the teens find themselves on a dangerous trajectory toward an inevitable and unforeseen collapse.\"'Breathe' is a very good title for a film that ever so gradually takes your breath away.-Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street JournalPre-Screening Live Music from JE Sunde 2:30-3:00pmBefore striking out on his own, Jon Sunde spent years making beautifully unusual music with The Daredevil Christopher Wright. In 2014 he released his first solo album, Shapes That Kiss The Lips Of God, with Cartouche Records out of Davenport, IA.

        "description": "This Halloween season, join us for another Everything is Terrible spectacular, only at The Royal. Everything Is Terrible! is the internet sensation video collective responsible for some of this millennium's most intriguing and mind melting videos. From Yogi Ogi Dogi, the creepy yoga farmer, to Cat Massage to Pubic Hair Dying to the Yellow Dino who hunts pedophiles; for 7 years EIT! has mined the absurd VHS universe for the best/worst bits. Every video is original and fantastic media art that creates a window into America's hidden past and future! Now, Everything Is Terrible! is back with the Legends show - coming to The Royal for one night only in October. Once a millenium, something emerges from the darkest corner of the universe and enlightens us to the true meaning of being. Something so mystickal, so magickal, and so mind-splitting that all concepts before its existence sounds stupid and boring. Of course, we are talking about Everything Is Terrible! The Legends show is a culmination of the first seven (of 777) years of work from the video alchemists at EIT! These mindfreaks have taken thousands of forgotten VHS tapes, chewed them up, and spit them back to their young via daily website postings, six movies, and world tours. In that time, they’ve exposed us to wonders such as massaging cat ladies, apocalyptic facial exercises, pizzas parties in hell, and our immortal party-god, Duane. Nobody could have predicted the cultural, psychological, and illuminating impact EIT! would have on our consciousness, but seeing all their greatest works chronicled in one place reminds us that in the right hands, garbage can be turned into gold! It is time pack up your copies of Jerry Maguire and accept the fact that your life up until this moment has been pointless.Check out the trailer HERE. ",

        "title": "Adopting an Identity",
        "description": "Join us as four authors—Lee Herrick, Tracy O’Neill, Matthew Salesses, and Sung J. Woo—read from new books that grapple with the realities of adoption, broken families, and the journeys we take to find out where we belong. All of their protagonists are adoptees, as well as three of the authors.Matthew Salesses’s The Hundred Year Flood (Little A 2015) was named one the year’s most anticipated debut novels by Buzzfeed, The Millions, Refinery29, and Gawker. As Roxane Gay writes: “Tee is in Prague. He is running away from memory. He is running toward myth. He is searching. In Prague, Tee meets an artist and the artist's wife. Before long, the three are drawn into a fateful series of events as Prague is laid bare by a flood that only comes every hundred years. This beautiful debut novel by Matthew Salesses is much like that flood—epic and devastating and full of natural majesty.” An editor for The Offing and The Good Men Project, Matthew spoke to us about ghosts and America in The Margins and previously wrote for us about how literature, adoption, and being a parent helped him think about the 2012 Sikh temple shooting. (Oh, and he recently played on team AAWW for a Houston fundraiser for books nonprofits!)Lee Herrick’s Gardening Secrets of the Dead (WordTech 2012) documents his search for his birth family in South Korea. Rife with explorations of memory, history, and attempts to “contact the dead,” Lee’s poetry is a “lyric exploration of the fractured and fragmented landscape of the self, where the body is a song composed of many selves” (Brian Turner). Check out his poetry in our special adoptee poetry portfolio.In Tracy O’Neill’s debut novel The Hopeful (Ig Publishing 2015), a fiercely independent 17 year old adoptee named Aliprovo Doyle is utterly consumed with competing in the Olympics. When a bone-breaking fall destroys her lifelong dreams, her life spirals into an addiction to amphetamines and an obsession with weight loss. As Karolina Waclawiak writes, “Though Doyle fights to keep us at arm's length with crackling comebacks, we can't help but notice, and want to protect, her tender brokenness as she struggles to break free from a body that has failed her.\" The book was long-listed for the 2015 Center For Fiction First Novel Prize and Tracy herself was awarded the Center for Fiction’s NYC Emerging Writers Fellowship.Sung J. Woo's latest novel, Love Love (Soft Skull 2015), follows two radically different siblings as they deal with distant parents, failed marriages, and the realization that one of them is adopted. Koream writes, \"Woo, whose 2009 debut novel, Everything Asian, was a Korean American immigrant tale that was somewhat autobiographical, has accomplished something very significant with his latest work. In the tradition of such American classics as John Steinbeck’s East of Eden or Toni Morrison’s Beloved, Love Love explores the impossibility of breaking free from patterns and the hopeless fallacy that, as our parents’ offspring, we will be able to start life with a clean slate.\" Check out his story “The Suitcase” in The Margins.",

        "description": "Do your doctor’s visits remind you of the collected works of Franz Kafka? Did your blood pressure spike when you heard about the pharmaceutical CEO who raised the price of an AIDS pill from $13.50 to $750? Well, come hear memoirists Deanna Fei, Sandeep Jauhar, and Dora Wang discuss how the medical industry commodifies its patients and sacrifices the sick at the altar of profit.In February 2014, the CEO of AOL, Tim Armstrong, cut the retirement plans of thousands of employees and blamed it on a rather unusual scapegoat. He said two “distressed” babies had racketed up exorbitant healthcare costs. Writer Deanna Fei was the mother of one of these babies and rebutted Armstrong’s almost cartoonishly evil account in a highly-publicized essay that caused a national media frenzy. Deanna’s memoir Girl In Glass (Bloomsbury 2015) tells the harrowing account of giving birth at five-and-a-half months and seeing her vulnerable child cling to life with a birth weight of one pound nine ounces. Describing this “courageous and passionate” book, Andrew Solomon wrote that Girl In Glass “takes memoir as a jumping-off point for pondering the obligations attached to scientific progress”--by asking “how much a human life is ultimately worth,” the book “becomes a deeply moving work of moral philosophy.” Deanna is the author of the novel Thread of Sky and a former AAWW Open City Fellow.Frequent New York Times-contributor Sandeep Jauhar diagnoses the future of medicine from the doctor’s point of view in Doctored: The Disillusionment of an American Physician (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2014). The memoir describes the fraught culture of 21st century medicine from the point of view of an idealistic, angry physician-writer: burnt-out doctors, unhappy patients, bureaucratic hospitals, and for-profit private practices devoted to drumming up fees. As Abraham Verghese writes, “Medicine's radical transformation in recent years has brought both incredible scientific advances and an increasingly dysfunctional health care system. Doctored takes us behind the façade and allows us to see the seamy underbelly. Jauhar's gift is to observe and to beautifully tell the stories. In doing so he leads us to a visceral understanding of what has gone wrong. Doctored is a manifesto for reform.”Author and physician Dora Wang moderates this thrilling conversation that bridges both deeply personal stories and deeply structural problems. Dora’s book Kitchen Shrink: A Psychiatrist's Reflections on Healing in a Changing World (Riverhead 2011) chronicles how the deregulation of medicine in the 1980s created the for-profit health care crisis. As Booklist wrote: \"In a memoir that reads like a quest, psychiatrist Wang reports a decades-long mission to discover or, rather, rediscover the profession to which she once aspired and that is currently becoming more and more obscured by the burgeoning so-called health-care industry.”",

You just have to know where to look and when to look the other way. Pitting grand landscapes against dinners of fried chicken and the roar of V8 engines on Saturday nights, Tired Moonlight wanders through Solitaire games (always won), secrets lost in cavernous hearts, and the fifty miles of bad road that always gets you home.\"Ms. West has an easygoing, perceptive sense of character and place, and an almost complete allergy to cliché. Tired Moonlight has some of the romantic melancholy promised in its title, but it’s also full of the oddness and vitality that are essential to the continued promise of American cinema (and American life).\"-A.O.

The Bass Coast Music Festival's co-founder and music curator has been making some very loud noises up and down the Pacific Northwest for the better part of a decade. Her knack for blending total dance floor destruction with sly subtleties and hot new exclusives makes for a consistently accessible, yet undeniably future sound. Indeed, her festival's carefully crafted music line-up is a perfect mirror of her style. Serving up a veritable who's who of the West Coast bass scene and reaching deep both backwards and forwards, The Librarian offers up unabashedly hard-hitting low-end bliss paired withthoughtful, sophisticated chops.In addition to curating and co-producing Bass Coast since its 2009 inauguration, Andrea has toured the Pacific Northwest club &amp; festival circuit extensively (Shambhala, Symbiosis, Rifflandia, WTF!, Sonic Bloom, Tall Tree, Burning Man, Sync, Envision, Meme, World Ski &amp; Snowboarding Festival, Crankworks and more), and has performed as far way as Costa Rica &amp; throughout the midwest inCan &amp; USA. In summer 2013, The Librarian was officially made a member of West Coast's notorious Lighta! Sound crew, joining deep bass pioneers Michael Red, Daega Sound, Max Ulis, Self Evident, Taal Mala, Mandai, Tank Gyal, Cure, &amp; Calamalka. The Librarian currently has releases out on East Van Digital and King Deluxe with more to come in 2015. Her monthly residency is in Whistler B.C. at Maxx Fish's Really Good Tuesdays with Mat The Alien.

We’ve got a huge amount of information available about everything that happens to your account, delivered in JSON over either a lovingly crafted REST API or web hooks pushed to you in real-time..We’re excited to see what you’ll build with it, from realtime dashboards, to intelligent apps, to physical internet-connected devices like our 3D printed fuel gauge for your bank account.This is the bank API you’ve been waiting for. At the beginning of the hackathon we will give each team access to: Our prototype mobile application (iOS only for now)\nA client id and secret to access our API\n\nThen you get to build cool things for two days :D Our engineering team will be around to help with any issues you might run into.What kinds of things can I build?Some examples to get your creative juices flowing: An integration that checks you into Foursquare every time you pay somewhere with a card\nMatch up parsed email receipts via Context.io with bank transactions and automatically attach amazon receipts and images to your transactions in your banking app\nA financial gamification app that observes my transactions and gives me points for streaks and exploring new locations\nSee what people built during our first HackatonWho can participate?Anyone who ever wished their bank had an API!How are teams formed? Can I work alone?We will ask people with ideas to pitch them to the participants. After the pitches, people form into teams organically. If you'd rather work alone, we can try to accommodate that.What capabilities does your API have?The API is documented here. You can list transactions, create pretty feed items that are visible in the app's main view, and receive web hooks when a transaction is made.Is this an overnight thing? When do I go home?The hackathon kicks off 10am on Saturday and goes on until around 5 or 6pm. We will reconvene at 10am on Sunday and work until the final presentations at 4pm.Are there any prizes?Fame and glory! :) This is the first hackathon we're running on the first version of our soon-to-be legendary API.You will also receive one of the first Mondo cards once they come off the press, and be one of the first developers to play with the API. Who knows, maybe you'll start a whole new business or side project off the back of our API once we launch. We also encourage you to write and blog about your experiences on the internet if you enjoy that kind of thing ;-)Is food and drink provided?Absolutely! We will probably get pizza, snacks, non-alcoholic beverages and beers from our namesake MONDO brewery.I have further questions…Great! Please don't hesitate to reach out to hackathons@getmondo.co.uk with any questions or if you have an idea you'd like to discuss.",

        "description": "Welcome to the Syracuse International Film Festival 2015. This is our 12th annual film festival. We have another fantastic festival filled with amazing films, special guests, receptions, live music, talks and our Filmmakers Forum. Call Me Lucky - Bob Goldthwait \"Bobcat\" American Actor/Writer/DirectorA favorite of Syracuse International Film Festival and The Sundance Film Festival, Bob’s films have a popular following and have been nominated for awards.Bob is a loyal Syracuse International Film Festival friend and a member of our Honorary Board. Bob’s newest film Call Me Lucky was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary at Sundance 2015. Barry Crimmins will be present for a talk-back after the screening.From IMDB:“Barry Crimmins is p******. His hellfire brand of comedy has rained verbal lightning bolts on American audiences and politicians for decades, yet you've probably never heard of him. But once you've experienced Bobcat Goldthwait's brilliant character portrait of him and heard Crimmins's secret, you will never forget him. From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-up style that took early audiences by force. Through stark, smart observation and judo-like turns of phrase, Crimmins's rapid-fire comedy was a war on ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the height of an ill-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses another side of his character, revealing in detail a dark and painful past that inspired his life-changing campaign of activism in the hope of saving others from a similar experience. Interviews with comics like Margaret Cho and Marc Maron illustrate Crimmins's love affair with comedy and his role in discovering and supporting the development of many of today's stars. As a venerated member of America's comic community, Crimmins could be your newest national treasure. Just don't tell him that.”Please check out Bobcat's Late Night Event - God Bless America. Purchase your ticket from both events and save. A complete list of all of screenings can be found at: www.filminsyracuse.com You can also signup for our online newsletter to get all the latest updates and learn more about our organization and the other events and work we do.

        "description": "Calling all beekeepers in their 20's and 30's!   There's a Next Gen Beekeepers Breakout session at the Western Apicultural Society Conference, and we want you there!  Join us for free beer, some desert, live music, and an opportunity to connect with other young beekeepers.   A January 23rd article in the Wall Street Journal titled, “More Beekeepers Sour on Profession as Winter Die-Offs Continue,” is an all-too familiar sentiment moving through the beekeeping industry.  To keep a colony thriving, recruitment must outnumber loss.  With the average age of beekeepers nearing 70, and only 8% under the age of 40 (Bee Culture, 2007, Flottum), we are not headed for success.  The Next Generation Beekeepers Initiative is aiming to amend this trend, by not just simply listing problems in the beekeeping industry, but identifying real solutions and pairing them with action.  The night will kick-off with beer, desert, and live music by Jim Deeming - then we'll get down to the nitty gritty.  I'll share what the group came up with last year in Missoula, then we'll spend time putting our present thoughts and experiences down, and come up with the building blocks of a \"strategic\" plan and a few action items for the coming year.  Your co-facilitators for the evening are next gen beekeepers, Sarah Red-Laird, Dan Wyns, Bernardo Nino, and we've also roped the \"wise elder\" John Miller to join us again this year.  See below for bios, and we hope to hoist a pint for bees and beekeepers with you in October at WAS!  Join and share our Facebook event here.  About your facilitators: Sarah Red-Laird is the founder and Executive Director of the Bee Girl organization, a nonprofit with a mission to inspire and empower communities to conserve bees and their habitat. She is a graduate of the University of Montana's College of Forestry and Conservation with a degree in Resource Conservation, focused on community collaboration and environmental policy.Aside from running the Bee Girl organization’s programs, Sarah is the US Ambassador of the International Bee Research Association's (IBRA) BEEWORLD project, the Kids and Bees Director for the American Beekeeping Federation, a New York Bee Sanctuary Advisory Board member, is an active member of the Northwest Farmers Union, and is a mentor in the Oregon State Master Beekeepers Program, and the Regional Representative for the Southern Oregon Beekeepers Association.When she is not tirelessly working with bees, beekeepers, kids, farmers, land managers, and policy makers, Sarah heads for the hills with a camera, large backpack, fishing rod, bike or snowboard, and her best friend, Sophie the Yellow Lab. Bernardo  Niño works as a Staff Research Associate in Dr. Niño’s  Lab at  University of California @ Davis. He received a Master’s degree  in  Entomology from North Carolina State University (2009) where he  studied  the population and genetic colony structure of the Eastern  subterranean  termite under the direction of Dr. Ed Vargo.  Six years  ago he happily  made the transition to another social insect, the honey  bee, and now  keeps over 100 colonies happily buzzing to accommodate the  needs of all  the researchers in the lab. He has also developed a  number of  educational programs for diverse audiences and for the past 5  years he  has been involved with organizing and running Queen Rearing  Workshops. Dan  Wyns was introduced to the world of honeybees nearly a decade ago and immediately knew that bees would play a prominent role in the rest of his life.  After completing a degree in Natural Resource Management at the University of Michigan in 2005 he embarked on a  working holiday to New Zealand where he met a beekeeper shortly after arriving. An opportunity to assist moving hives for pollination grew into a full time position and his interest in beekeeping as a career and lifestyle increased as he learned more about the intricacies of a honeybee colony, the art of beekeeping, and the role of honeybees in agriculture and food production. During a 7 year stay in New Zealand Dan progressed to the position of apiary manager for Kerikeri Pollination, a diverse beekeeping operation running ~2200 colonies for kiwifruit pollination, manuka honey production, and queen rearing as well as running his own colonies for avocado pollination and acting as  regional apiary inspector.After leaving New Zealand in 2012 Dan managed bees in western Canada for pollination of blueberries, raspberries, and cranberries in lower mainland British Columbia and pursued honey in the prairies of northern Alberta. Dan currently works for the Bee Informed Partnership (BIP) through Oregon State University Honeybee Lab. BIP currently partners with 20 commercial beekeeping outfits in OR, WA, and ID to monitor colony health and evaluate hive management practices in order to help beekeepers make more informed management decisions. Dan is always up to share what he has learned from his experiences and chat about bees, beekeeping, and all things agriculture related and encourages you to contact him (Wyns.Dan@gmail.com) if he can be of any help to you or your bees.John Miller owns most of and operates part of Miller Honey Farms, Inc., with operations in Blackfoot, ID., Newcastle, CA., and Gackle, ND.The company operates about 15,000 hives; some years more, some years much less.  MHFI provides pollination services to almond and pit fruit growers in CA and WA; oil seed producers in N. D.His bees produce clover honey in N.D.; which is mostly sold to Dutch Gold Honey Co. of Lancaster, PA.  Miller is married to Prof. Janet H. Miller, Micro-biology Department Chair, at American River College, Sacramento, CA.They have four children, and a lot of grandchildren.  Miller serves as Board Member on the Bee Informed Project, and as CFO for Project Apis m.Other industry service includes Past-Chair, National Honey Board, and Past-President, California State Beekeepers Assn.He currently serves on the local Economic Development Corporation in Gackle, ND.He is current President of the Mountain Mandarin Growers Assn., President of En-R-G Holdings, LLC., of Steamboat Springs, CO.

        "description": "Public Presentation, Film &amp; Two Workshops - Sponsored by the Boise EcoVillage Project, the BSU Sustainability Club, and the Boise State Writing ProjectFree Public Event at the BSU Special Events CenterFriday, September 4th at 6 p.m.The presentation “Sustainable is Possible: Creating Low Carbon, High Quality Lives... Together” shows how we can live high quality lives while using only 10% of the resources of the average American. Q and A will follow the talk. The Film “Inhabit” will follow the presentationINHABIT explores the many environmental issues facing us today and examines solutions that are being applied using the ecological design process called 'Permaculture'. Permaculture is a design lens that uses the principles found in ecosystems to help shift our impact from destructive to regenerative. Focused mostly on the Northeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, Inhabit provides an intimate look at permaculture peoples and practices ranging from rural, suburban, and urban landscapes. Half-Day Workshop: Starting a Sustainable CommunityXanadu Community Center, 5015 W Bond St., Boise, IdahoFriday, September 4th from 9 - 1Cooperation is a key element of sustainability, and a sense of community is critical for our well-being as humans. Many people feel drawn to a particular version of community: the residential intentional community. This workshop draws on years of knowledge from community founders, and Ma’ikwe’s own 18 years of cooperative living, including three community start-ups, to lay out the most important considerations for making a new community a success. Blending practical advice with opportunities for self-reflection, this workshop can help you set your feet on the right path for your group to thrive. Topics will include: creating a good vision statement, what successful founders have in common, the relationship between decision-making, conflict resolution, and membership process, 15 spectrums that help define what kind of a community you are creating, social dynamics you need to know about, economic choices and their implication for sustainability and group cohesion, what you should-- and shouldn't-- freak out about, and key questions for making your community a sustainable one.Full-Day Workshop: Rethinking SustainabilityBSU Student Union Bldg, Lookout RoomSaturday, September 5th from 9 – 5What do you think of when you hear the word sustainability? Organic food, wind turbines, natural building and electric cars? Those things matter for sure, but real sustainability goes well beyond the ecological choices we make, and touches on social dynamics, economics, and our fundamental worldview. This class introduces the relationships between the four dimensions of sustainability, drawing on a curriculum developed by ecovillages all over the world. If we are going to really address issues like climate change, it is essential that we look more deeply at how we define sustainability and what we are willing to question, rethink, and re-envision about how we live our lives. About the workshop leader: Ma’ikwe Schaub Ludwig is a pioneering sustainability educator who heads up Ecovillage Education US, and a member of the Board of Directors of the Fellowship for Intentional Community. Her work integrates ecological, economic, social, political and personal approaches and technologies for a strongly holistic view of what real sustainability takes, and we expect the talk to have broad appeal across the disciplines. Ma'ikwe is a regular writer for Communities magazine and is the author of Passion as Big as a Planet: Evolving Eco- Activism in America. Ma’ikwe is a dynamic speaker, and she has been featured on TEDx in 2013 with her talk on sustainability.

Here, in the country’s second oldest town, one will find the Eerste River flowing out of the mountains and into a shallow, alluvial and fertile valley. A clear metaphor for the potential within each human being.TEDxStellenbosch is a unique community that celebrates world-changing African ideas. A curated lineup of speakers and storytellers from across disciplines take to the stage to inspire an audience of between 450 and 550 thinkers and doers. The annual gathering sees a collision of great minds, whether young or old, although always with a sense of wonder and curiosity. The sparks ignited and the relationships started allow ideas to roll beyond the one day event. The ideas shared from the stage are only one component. It is the community that develops around the event that is the true magic of TEDxStellenboschOur world evolved from a storied past and has an uncertain future. With such radical disruption taking place globally, in both business and society, there seems to be no better time than now to ask questions - questions about how it got to where it is today, how it could have been different, and more importantly, how it could change in the future.At TEDxStellenbosch 2015 we start with ourselves and our own environment, we will look into the past, present, and future. We will bring together a group of thinkers and doers, both speakers and attendees, for a day of asking visionary questions - questions that start with thwo words: What if…Now it is your turn. Plant the seed of an idea wherever you can, and water it with passion and energy, so that it may one day sustain us all. “I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something.

        "description": "Join us for an evening featuring Tanwi Nandini Islam and Naomi Jackson, whose debut novels share a setting in Brooklyn, home to so many families who call somewhere else home. Born to immigrant parents, Islam's and Jackson’s heroines wrestle with competing cultural messages, gender norms, and a poignant sense of placelessness, all while navigating the tribulations of teenhood in America. In Islam’sBright Lines, the Bangladeshi Saleem family raises three girls on Cambridge Place: rebellious Charu, bookish adoptee Ella, and runaway Maya, who seeks refuge from her abusive father. When their home falls victim to fire, the Saleem family returns to Bangladesh, where they must confront the demons of their past alongside the ones of the present. Home and homeland come into conflict again in Jackson’s The Star Side of Bird Hill, when the Braithwaite sisters, Dionne and Phaedra, are torn from Brooklyn and sent to Bird Hill, Barbados to live with their grandmother. Jackson transports the reader through history, tracking the stories of three generations of Braithwaite women, and confronting love, mental illness, and the struggles of immigration. The discussion will be moderated by the Workshop's very own, Nadia Q. Ahmad!Brooklyn resident Tanwi Nandini Islam’s writing has appeared in Elle.com, Fashionista.com, Open City, Women 2.0, Billboard.com, and Gawker.  She is the founder ofHi Wildflower Botanica, a 2013-2014 AAWW Open City Fellow, and a graduate of Vassar College and the Brooklyn College MFA program.Naomi Jackson was born in raised in Brooklyn, and graduated from Williams College. She has studied writing at the Iowa Writer’s Workshop and the University of Cape Town in South Africa.AAWW Program Assistant Nadia Q. Ahmad is a writer. A board member of the Bangladesh Institute of Performing Arts (BIPA) and 2015 VONA/Voices alum, Nadia currently lives in East Elmhurst, Queens.",

After serving the court for three decades, the king’s tailor Jo Dol-seok (Han Suk-kyu) is on the brink of rising to the rank of nobleman. But his life's dream is threatened with the sudden appearance of young, handsome, and carefree “designer” Lee Gong-jin whose radical fashion ideas quickly earn the Queen's favor. Unlike most films about the power of art (and music), Lee lets Jo Sang-gyeong’s striking costume designs speak for themselves, without resorting to reaction shots or exposition. The film's traditional costumes took as much as six months to create, at a cost just shy of $1 million. A playful, fresh, and daring reinvention of one of Korea’s most conservative film genres.",

        "description": "Join us for a special event celebrating a new anthology of Filipino myths: Kuwento: Lost Things. We’ll hear from three contributors from the anthology: Anna Alves, PhD student in American Studies at Rutgers University, Newark; Sarah Gambito, cofounder of Kundiman; and Melissa R. Sipin, co-editor of Kuwento). Moderated by acclaimed novelist Jessica Hagedorn, author of Toxicology and a winner of the AAWW Lifetime Achievement Award.In 2011, Melissa R. Sipin and Rachelle Cruz began Kuwento: Lost Things as a search, an obsession, a need to excavate the stories of anitos (deities) and engkantos (spirits) their families once told them. But, when they first indulged in the idea of curating an anthology on Philippine myths, they were struck by how diverse the retellings were. Was the Aswang a bat-like vampire woman? Or was she a shape-shifting beast, or a giant black bird with a long, fetus-eating tongue? They understood that the stories passed on to them from their fathers and mothers were varied, but also culturally inherited. It was as if their bodies knew the stories, and knew them well. This book, a diverse collection of eclectic prose and poetry, seeks to ensure that their \"invocation of the past is somehow answered, somehow quelled, somehow excavated, and thus, reborn—reborn in our own terms, in our own myths, in our own kuwentos.\"Co-sponsored by TAYO Literary Magazine, Kweli Journal, the AASP at Hunter College, and the Hunter College NEH Summer Seminar for School Teachers: Asian Americans in New York: Film &amp; Literature.Image titled \"Fishers of Men,\" by Eliseo Art Silva.",

Proceeds from the showcase will benefit Santa Barbara School of Performing Arts scholarship students.Featuring a talented cast of local young performers ranging in age from 11 to 15, and set to an unforgettable rock score from Tony Award-winning composer Jason Robert Brown, 13 is a hilarious, high-energy musical for all ages about discovering that cool is where you find it—and  sometimes where you least expect it.  Directed by Austin Escamilla with musical direction by Dauri Kennedy, the cast of 13 includes Anthony Jensen (12) in the lead role, and Grace Gibbs (15) and Kara Boger (13) double cast in the role of Patrice. Other cast members include Kai Kadlec (15), Greta Regan (13), Drewes McFarlin (12), Logan Fleming, Mariana Mezic (13), Dawson Escamilla (11), and others. Director Austin Escamilla is also a homegrown talent who has starred in two SOPA shows. 13 is his second show as director.Arete Productions is the company that brought the Tony Award-nominated musical Swing! to the New Vic Theatre last March, featuring the beloved music of jazz greats Duke Ellington, William “Count” Basie, Benny Goodman, and Glenn Miller. In 2014, Arete Productions presented the Tony Award-winning rock musical Rent, with four sold-out shows and a review by the national theater publication Broadway World.“It's great working with the cast of 13,” Arete founder and 13 musical director Dauri Kennedy says. “Seeing their growth is wonderful. Many of them have been in our debut track, developing singing, dancing, and acting skills; some are brand new to the stage. 13 presents a unique opportunity to develop into mature performers because the entire cast is young.” The preview night showcase is a perfect accompaniment to this production because proceeds will benefit these and other young and intermediate performers, many of whom go on to  professional training programs based on having their talents recognized and nurtured at an early age. Featured in the showcase will be the local high school band Vital Signs, led by Brolin Parris, who is a SOPA alum and a longtime student of Kennedy's from Marymount of Santa Barbara, the Inner Light Community Gospel Choir, and others.Santa Barbara School of Performing Arts was founded by Dauri M. Kennedy in 2012. SBSOPA’s mission is to nurture, motivate and build confidence in our community’s youth through the use of contemporary and classic theatrical works.In addition to directing the Santa Barbara School of Performing Arts and Arete Productions, Kennedy also heads DMK Studio and Performing and Visual Arts Camp (PVAC). She is on the music faculty of Marymount and Santa Barbara City College Adult Education and director of Inner Light Community Gospel Choir. She attended the renowned New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA), earned a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Illinois and a Master of Music from UCSB. She is an alumna of the Music Academy of the West and was a featured soloist with the SB City College Jazz Band, Chamber Orchestra, and Grand Opera.

Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a programmer at an internet-search giant, wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company’s brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test—charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan’s latest experiment in artificial intelligence. That experiment is Ava (Alicia Vikander), a breathtaking A.I. whose emotional intelligence proves more sophisticated––and more deceptive––than the two men could have imagined.With a musical performance by Sam DrysdaleDepending on how much rain is falling, the event may be able to move indoors at 99 Sudbury and run on the same schedule as if it were outside.

Since 1995 Matmos have made recordings and performed live using the sounds of amplified crayfish nerve tissue, the pages of bibles turning, a bowed five string banjo, slowed down whistles and kisses, water hitting copper plates, the runout groove of a vinyl record, a $5.00 electric guitar, liposuction surgery, cameras and VCRs, chin implant surgery, contact microphones on human hair, a five gallon bucket of oatmeal, and the vagina, uterus, and reproductive tract of a cow. Matmos released albums under Matador Records for nine years before signing with Thrill Jockey in 2012, and has also been found collaborating with Björk both on studio recordings and live tours.Kevin Blechdom (Kristin Erickson) is the avenging angel of pop music. Armed with a laptop, top notch programming skills, keyboard and a banjo, Ms. Blechdom has brought much needed life into electronic music with her one woman show filled with Song, Dance, Blood and Guts.

        "description": "Closing Night!World Premiere!Burnt In MemoryBurnt in Memory, My Lover has Steel Legs and Street Lights for EyesRobert Stockwell73 min., Video, 2015, USA\"Burnt in Memory chronicles life in Chicago. Its impressionistic tableau has no dialogue, no characters, no story, and no acts. It is just a glimpse of people and their places, their in between places, and their forgotten places.  Burnt in Memory documents the mundane. The places passed on the way to work. Finding the moments worth looking at, showing something you've seen but never remembered. It's seeing again the things all around that are filled with life and yet forgotten about.  The film/video is an experiment to rewind and strip away the conventions about narratives in documentaries. My intent is to bring back the simplicity of walking around with a camera capturing life and moments, without the overuse of effects, and very little money. I entrust the viewer to see for themselves.  The music is entirely improvised. The musicians include Azita Youssefi on piano, Amber Amar-Walton on cello, Justin Martin on guitar, Nandini Khaund on the Folktek Quadrum, and Ben Clarke as musical director. These mainstay Chicago musicians played to a projection of the film and the results are unique and varied from most every other film score. Rather than composing restrictive melodies and rhythms the musicians played just as freely and uninhibited as Burnt in Memory was photographed.  I hope you enjoy seeing Chicago as I see it. It's a city steeped in stereotypes, but after wandering around the city day after day its true personality comes forth. Its beauty and ugliness, its power and frailty, its inhabitants and its abandoned caverns are what makes this city intriguing. It's been a pleasure to explore Chicago completely without commercial pretense. We're not trying to sell you on Chicago. We're not saying, \"come on over, the water is nice!\" We're simply sharing what we see.\" - Robert StockwellThis special world premiere screening of Burnt In Memory will feature a live soundtrack, and filmmaker Robert Stockwell in attendance!!",

USADirected by Ali EldinBrooklyn PremiereIn 1894 Darling Duke Lynch slipped the noose at Blackwater. With the help of an old man named 'Shaky' they must travel the countryside and learn how to survive before the law catches up to them. With harsh weather and bandits at their back there is much to learn when the gun goes down.Brooklyn Connection:Though most of the film was not shot in Brooklyn, the film would not be complete without it. The entire grip team, best boy, sound, and one of my strongest AD's were from Brooklyn. I think its safe to say the entire backbone of the production was born and bred in Brooklyn. They kept the wheels turning and saved time from burning. Without these men and women I could have not have done what I did. I have nothing but appreciation and respect for them, and I thank you for giving them someplace to show off all their hard work and dedication.Lake NowhereHorror, 50 min. USADirected by Christopher Phelps and Maxim Van ScoyBrooklyn PremiereFrom the vaults of the golden age of slasher films comes LAKE NOWHERE, a raucous, bloody romp which resurrects the thrill of gory midnight movies for an hour-long plunge into the depths of horror. Inspired by the dusty days of VHS, LAKE NOWHERE is preceded by original trailers &amp; commercials, replicating the experience of watching a long lost bootleg tape.When a group of friends arrive at a desolate lakeside cabin, they are stalked and murdered by a Masked Maniac, whose lust for blood transcends our world. This age-old tale of senseless slaughter quickly spirals into the realm of supernatural horror and classic monster movies, as we learn the true power that lies within LAKE NOWHERE.LAKE NOWHERE was shot over six intense days in a remote cabin on the Great Sacandaga Lake in Upstate New York, at the base of the historic Adirondack Park, with a skeleton crew of ten people, eight actors and a dog. LAKE NOWHERE was produced almost entirely out-of-pocket, with additional funds crowd-sourced through IndieGoGo.From concept-to-screen, LAKE NOWHERE took just over one year to produce. As the project grew in scope, additional actors and crew were brought on to create the supplemental material which has become an integral part of the experience of LAKE NOWHERE.Brooklyn Connection:LAKE NOWHERE was written and produced by the Brooklyn-based production company, Ursidae Parade. Christopher Phelps, the co-director, co-writer, and editor of the film, also lives in the borough, along with many of the actors and crew.While LAKE NOWHERE was shot in Upstate New York, the supplemental material that precedes the film was shot in part in Bushwick and neighboring Ridgewood.",

With Google Fiber in Provo and now Salt Lake --  and with Gigabit Networks available in the 11 cities served by the Utah  Telecommunications Open Infrastructure Agency, or UTOPIA -- Utah is  poised to be the first state where a substantial portion of its  residents have access to the fastest-possible broadband internet  services.What does Google's investments say about the economic  health and technology-savvy nature of Utah? What do cities and citizens  get from Google Fiber that they haven't gotten from traditional telecom  companies? And, for cities and states seeking to get a Gig, what are the  best options to build and enhance Gigabit Networks?Join us for discussing the future of GigUtah!Confirmed Panelists:\n\nDevin Baer, Head of Fiber Business, Salt Lake, Google\n\nPaul Cutler, Mayor, City of Centerville\n\nJustin Jones, Vice President, Public Policy and Communications, Salt Lake Chamber\n\nDavid Shaw, Shareholder, Kirton McConkie; Chair, Government and Utilities Practice Group\nOther panelists have been invited.\nModerated by Drew Clark, Of Counsel, Kirton McConkie; Founder, Utah Breakfast Club",

The Blue Oak Brewing Company will be here opening night serving up some locally crafted brews for us to enjoy. Kitty White, better known as Hello Kitty, was first introduced in Japan in 1974 and in the United States in 1976. Since then, this character—who if you didn't know is a girl from Britain who enjoys baking, traveling and listening to music— has become an iconic image recognized worldwide. For this show, we have asked local artists to reimagine Sanrio's Kitty White in any artistic form they choose. You can expect to see a wide range of techniques and mediums used from this year's group; all of which place their own individual stamp on this time honored character.Featuring Artwork by:Mark Adamusik  NORIO FUJIKAWAZEBULON GOODELL  Krista WrightElliott C.

This full day of panels and talks on Feb. 28 is open to people of all  backgrounds, ages, faiths, and cultures as a means of facilitating  dialogue, networking, and tools for pursuing “literature as an agent of  social, intellectual, and spiritual change.” The event is NOT an event  exclusively for Muslims, “minorities,” or Columbia  students/faculty—everyone is welcome.2015.muslimprotagonist.comIn its third year, The Muslim Protagonist will build  on the previous years’ remarkable successes and delve deeper into the  issue of marginalized narratives in and outside of Muslim communities in  a unique and thoughtful way, bringing  together writers from diverse communities in America. This year’s theme,  “Art as Protest,” will feature discussions surrounding art and  literature as agents of socio-political, intellectual, and spiritual  change. We will be examining questions such as: What does it mean to  produce and interpret non-canonical literature? What does it mean to be a  subject, a citizen, a community member, an artist, and a protagonist?  What roles do literary and artistic works play in the charged political  climate dominating our world today? What role have they played  historically for Muslims in and outside of modern America, and what  lessons if any do they provide us with today? What is at stake in  producing work that disrupts dominant narratives?LOCATION: 417 SIPA, 420 W 118th St #1, New York, NY 10027",

Ruben Östlund / 2014 / 118 minutesA Swedish family travels to the French Alps to enjoy a few days of skiing. The sun is shining and the slopes are spectacular but, during a lunch at a mountainside restaurant, an avalanche turns everything upside down. With diners fleeing in all directions, Ebba calls for her husband Tomas as she tries to protect their children. Tomas, meanwhile, is running for his life... The anticipated disaster failed to occur, and yet the family's world has been shaken to its core, a question mark hanging over their father in particular.

        "description": "\n\nAs   part of our celebration of Walt Disney Animation Studio, we asked two   well-known animation historians, Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck, to curate a   selection of their favourite Disney short cartoons. Their selections run the   gamut of Walt Disney's peak period between the 1930s-1950s.They feature a mix   of standards (Skeleton Dance, Clock Cleaners, Hockey Homicide), oddities (Der   Fuehrer's Face, No Smoking) and a few unexpected gems.And don't be surprised   if you see some famous characters here and there.     \"Picking a program of favorite   Disney cartoon shorts isn't as easy as you'd think. The general consensus is   that while Disney excelled at feature length animation, his movies filled   with strong storytelling and superb character animation, the studio's short   cartoons are supposedly lacking.They pale in comparison to Fleischer, Warner   Bros. and MGM's library of classic cartoons. Nothing could be further from   the truth. While Walt's personal attention veered away from shorts and was   focused on the features and theme parks in the 1940s and 50s, he left Mickey   Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy in some very talented hands and the Disney   shorts of that era were still the ones the other studios were trying to beat.        The earlier films, the cartoons produced by the studio in the 1930s, are   still miraculous by any standardliterally pushing the medium forward on a film-by-film   basis.\"Jerry Beck     Suitable for all ages. \n",

        "description": "The IdeaWe love wine. We love making it. We love sharing it. We love exploring all that it has to offer. We have found that some vintages and varietals are best experienced by groups of people for reasons ranging from bottle size to availability, and of course cost.Flight Club is our attempt to form a group of fellow explorers who will join us in a series where we look at some of the most fabled and beloved regions and wines around the world.We’ll taste, learn, possibly argue and definitely laugh—capitalizing on the power of a collective to purchase wines beyond our reach as individuals, peruse regions and bottle formats we’d never dream of on our own, and broaden our palettes. At the end of each club meeting, we will let the group elect the region, varietal, or format we’ll explore next. Wine for the people, by the people!Episode #1: Barolo NightWe will taste five (5) Barolos from the Piedmont region of Italy. Barolo is made from Nebbiolo grape and is considered one of the most important and praised wines of the world. The Romans planted grapes in the first century AD and the Nebbiolo grape has been planted there since the 1300s. These wines are typically highly structured and designed for years of aging. The rule of thumb for Barolos is to age for 15 years before you open them! It has been called “The King of Wines” and the 2000s has brought a string of fantastic vintages for Piedmont. We will be picking three to four wines from the historic 2004 to 2008 vintages. We will also taste a Barolo from the 1990s so we can experience a more aged Barolo. These wines are traditionally described as tasting of tar and roses--we will see if we can find those notes!-- but also have notes of chocolate, dried fruit, leather, mint, plum, spices and even truffles. We will also explore the tension in Barolo between the Traditionalists and the Modernists; the shift in techniques and approach between these producer groups and how that has affected the taste, age potential and “approachability” of the wine at younger ages.If any of the wines have a lasting impression, we can special order them for you. The question is if you can wait 15 years to drink them….Tasting Party: Sept 24th 2014 6.30pmphoto credit: made-in-italy.com",

In his compelling new film TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM, award-winning director Morgan Neville shines a spotlight on the untold true story of the backup singers behind some of the greatest musical legends of the 21st century.

Originally from Quispamsis, New Bruswick, Jill recently relocated to Toronto after winning Slaight Music’s annual “It’s Your Shot” contest and is now hard at work with some of Canada's most acclaimed and successful songwriters and producers.______________________________________________________________________Depending on how much rain is falling the event may be able to move indoors at 99 Sudbury and run on the same schedule as if it were outside.

The movie will be followed by filmmaker Q &amp; A with Jen and Grant and a reception.Synopsis:Filmmakers and food lovers Jen and Grant dive into the issue of  waste from farm, through retail, all the way to the back of their own  fridge. After catching a glimpse of the billions of dollars of good food  that is tossed each year in North America, they pledge to quit grocery  shopping cold turkey and survive only on foods that would otherwise be  thrown away. In a nation where one in 10 people is food insecure, the  images they capture of squandered groceries are both shocking and  strangely compelling. But as Grant’s addictive personality turns full  tilt towards food rescue, the ‘thrill of the find’ has unexpected  consequences.Featuring interviews with TED lecturer, author and activist  Tristram Stuart and acclaimed author Jonathan Bloom, Just Eat It looks  at our systemic obsession with expiry dates, perfect produce and portion  sizes, and reveals the core of this seemingly insignificant issue that  is having devastating consequences around the globe. Just Eat It brings  farmers, retailers, inspiring organizations, and consumers to the table  in a cinematic story that is equal parts education and delicious  entertainment.",

He ends up staying in a homeless shelter, singing at downtown bars to survive. His strong Southern accent and other misadventures will change his dream to become an actor and lead him to choose music over cinema. His song “Nel blu dipinto di blu” (better known as “Volare”) will receive two Grammys with sales over 22 million copies, and will represent Italy in the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest. “Volare” will revolutionize the Italian music scene of the 60s, becoming the soundtrack of a country now aiming for the sky.",

        "description": "Women Grow Networking Events connect aspiring and current professionals in the cannabis industry. Through our monthly events, our members develop authentic relationships via personal contact and networking. While our events are women focused, our networking series attracts both men and women to connect.\n\nSignature Networking Events occur the first Thursday of every month. Sign up for the Women Grow newsletter for the most up-to-date information on chapter and national events.\n\n\n\nFeatured Speaker\n\n\nMedicine, Music and Education\n\n\n\n\n\nSabina Lone - Medical Cannabis and the Endocannabinoid System\n\nWomen Grow Metro Detroit is honored to announce that one of their own members, Sabina Lone, AKA “Dr. Cannabina”, will be presenting a fun and educational power point presentation on the Endocannabinoid system, and how cannabis can be used as medicine. Sabina is a medical cannabis patient and activist, and finds her passion in educating others on all things cannabis. Her medicine, healthcare, and business background, with her love to learn and help people, keeps her eager in spreading the word on how Cannabis is medicine. Sabina thrives to help others learn how Cannabis can help them with medical ailments, and although she is not a medical physician, she can certainly guide and provide extensive knowledge on the subject matter.\n\nNikki Harris and Angela Carpenter will also be speaking on how CBD's helped their lives and families.\n\n\n\nSeptember Event Adgenda \n6:30PM Check-in and Open Networking\n\n7:30PM Sponsor Presentation\n\n7:45PM Featured Speaker\n\n8:30PM Open Networking\n\n11:00PM Meeting Concludes\n\n\n\nPre-sale tickets available: \n\nOctober Event - TBD\n\n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nWho attends? You'll meet women (and men) at all different stages of their career in the cannabis industry. Many will be in the research phase, just learning more about opportunities, while still working day jobs. Some are looking for jobs with existing organizations. Others are starting up their own cannabis venture or ancillary business. Depending on the status of legalization in your state, you'll also meet cannabis business owners &amp; investors who are well on their way. Watch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend? Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members. Together we have more power. As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events? We recommend bringing business cards and a pen to take notes. If you don't have business cards, check out Moo for 10% off your first order (and your first order supports Women Grow). Watch our video on networking tips from Women Grow founding members.\n\nWhere are there Women Grow events? Women Grow events are held in small towns and large cities, in prohibition and legalized states alike. No matter where your county is on the road to legalization, you can have a Women Grow chapter. Learn more about starting a Women Grow Chapter.\n\nAre there ID requirements to attend? All attendees must be 21 years or older and have a valid ID as many events occur in establishments serving alcohol.\n\nWhat are my transportation/parking options? Parking available onsite, for free.\n\nCan I pay at the door? Paying in advance helps speed up our check-in process and makes sure you receive all event announcements. If you are unable to pay in advance, please bring cash. Price is $40 at the door.\n\nAre tickets refundable or transferable? You may send a friend to attend in your place. Tickets are not refundable.\n\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No, as long as your ID matches the name your registered the ticket under. You may also show us your ticket on your mobile device. If you are giving your ticket to a colleague, please forward them the ticket to show us.\n\nAre events on different days other than the first Thursday of the month? Women Grow networking events are on the first Thursday of each month (except for holiday weeks). Social events can be planned at other times. Women Grow's national events are held a few times a year. Make sure you're on the Women Grow mailing list to receive invitations.\n\nWhy do you charge for events? Women Grow is funded by event proceeds and sponsors. We charge for our events so that Women Grow is a self-sustaining organization. If you are unable to afford an event, please contact the organizer to ask about volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy should I consider a career in the cannabis industry? Watch our videos on getting started in the cannabis industry and why women should get involved.\n\nTWITTER TIPS\n\nA great way to connect with fellow participants is to use common hashtags when tweeting about the event. You can use the same hashtags on Facebook. Photos rock. Please share them if you take any!\n\n#WomenGrow #cannabis #womenincannabis #mmj #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis\n",

Ask about our discount pricing for U.S. military veterans.\n\nLIKE us on Facebook: www.Facebook.com/NYSafetyandTraining\n\nVisit our website: www.NYSafetyandTraining.com\n\nNew York City Department of Buildings mandates that all workers at major construction sites must have had the OSHA 10-hour Construction Industry safety class within the last five years. DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\n\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\n\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\n\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\n\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\n\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\n\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\n\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\n\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\n\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\n\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\n\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\n\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\n\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\n\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n\n",

On August 26th, he will be joining forces with the Ben's Bells Project to tell us why we don’t have to deal with things alone. Instead, we can practice emotional hygiene, when we learn to identify and manage our minds and our emotions with as much attention and care as we give our physical bodies.

        "description": "The uniquely demanding terrain of Virgin, Utah, once again beckons the best mountain bike riders to the desert to compete for glory in one of the biggest tests of skill and guts in the world.\n\nJudged by former competitors, the 21 invited athletes have found an all-new event zone with more natural terrain options than recent years — returning the 11th edition of Rampage to the roots of big mountain riding, raw and untamed.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nSpectator Advisory\n\nRed Bull Rampage features the world's greatest riders tackling the most intense terrain any contest has offered – no novices here. The same applies for spectators; this event is not for casual observers. The new Red Bull Rampage venue was chosen for its ability to challenge the riders and push their limits, so it is remote, hot, dangerous, and unforgiving.\n\nIt is four miles to the contest venue over uneven desert terrain that you will either have to hike or pedal. If you ride it, you'll need to check your bike at the on-site bike valet once you reach the contest venue, no exceptions. Spectators will be required to stay within designated viewing areas at the base of the course near the finish line – no exceptions. No pets will be allowed, and non-adult spectators are not recommended. If this sounds harsh, that's because it is; this isn't a mountain resort, this is the desert. All on-site rules and requirements are necessary to ensure everyone's safety and enjoyment.\n\nIf you decide to attend, pack plenty of water, snacks, sunscreen, extra layers of clothing, basic first-aid gear, and a flashlight/headlamp as no provisions will be available on-site. In other words, treat it like an unsupported weekend ride with your buddies. Just think ahead, be smart, and come prepared.\n",

        "description": "Women Grow Networking Events connect aspiring and current professionals in the cannabis industry. Through our monthly events, our members develop authentic relationships via personal contact and networking. While our events are women focused, our networking series attracts both men and women to connect.\n\nSignature Networking Events occur the first Thursday of every month. Sign up for the Women Grow newsletter for the most up-to-date information on chapter and national events.\n\nSPEAKER &amp; TOPIC:\n\nWe would like to invite you to October’s Women Grow ABQ Networking event!\n\nEver wonder what it would be like if New Mexico became a recreational cannabis state? Please join us Thursday, October 6th in welcoming Nicole Olonovich to the Women Grow stage! Nicole will be speaking on her experience in customer service and management within Colorado’s medical and recreational environments. Come with your questions on how Colorado made the transition from medical to recreational, and how this move has impacted the industry. This month’s event will be taking place at Bow and Arrow Brewing Co.!\n\nSave $5 by purchasing your ticket online prior to Sunday, October 2nd.\n\nAt the door ticket price is $35\n\nEVENT AGENDA\n6:00PM Check-in and Open Networking6:15PM All About Women Grow and Why We Need More Diversity in the Cannabis Industry6:30PM Speaker Presentations7:45PM Open Networking8:30PM Meeting Concludes\n\n\nF.A.Q.\nWho attends? You'll meet women (and men) at all different stages of their career in the cannabis industry. Many will be in the research phase, just learning more about opportunities, while still working day jobs. Some are looking for jobs with existing organizations. Others are starting up their own cannabis venture or ancillary business. Depending on the status of legalization in your state, you'll also meet cannabis business owners &amp; investors who are well on their way. Watch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend? Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members. Together we have more power. As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events? We recommend bringing business cards and a pen to take notes. If you don't have business cards, check out Moo for 10% off your first order (and your first order supports Women Grow). Watch our video on networking tips from Women Grow founding members.\n\nWhere are there Women Grow events? Women Grow events are held in small towns and large cities, in prohibition and legalized states alike. No matter where your county is on the road to legalization, you can have a Women Grow chapter. Learn more about starting a Women Grow Chapter.\n\nAre there ID requirements to attend? All attendees must be 21 years or older and have a valid ID as many events occur in establishments serving alcohol.\n\nWhat are my transportation/parking options? There is plenty of free parking, but feel free to carpool with a friend!\n\nCan I pay at the door? Paying in advance helps speed up our check-in process and makes sure you receive all event announcements. If you are unable to pay in advance, please bring cash.\n\nAre tickets refundable or transferable? You may send a friend to attend in your place. Tickets are not refundable.\n\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No, as long as your ID matches the name your registered the ticket under. You may also show us your ticket on your mobile device. If you are giving your ticket to a colleague, please forward them the ticket to show us.\n\nAre events on different days other than the first Thursday of the month? Women Grow networking events are on the first Thursday of each month (except for holiday weeks). Social events can be planned at other times. Women Grow's national events are held a few times a year. Make sure you're on the Women Grow mailing list to receive invitations.\n\nWhy do you charge for events? Women Grow is funded by event proceeds and sponsors. We charge for our events so that Women Grow is a self-sustaining organization. If you are unable to afford an event, please contact the organizer to ask about volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy should I consider a career in the cannabis industry? Watch our videos on getting started in the cannabis industry and why women should get involved.\n\nTWITTER TIPS\n\nA great way to connect with fellow participants is to use common hashtags when tweeting about the event. You can use the same hashtags on Facebook. Photos rock. Please share them if you take any!\n\n#WomenGrow #cannabis #womenincannabis #mmj #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis\n",

They commandeer the motor home of the Rev Fuller (Keitel) to evade the cops en route to a midnight rendezvous at the Titty Twister, hottest whorehouse in all Mexico. Along for the ride are Fuller's teen kids, and the Reverend himself, who has most definitely picked the wrong day to lose his faith. Written by Tarantino in 1990 on a commission from a special effects company, the film is aimed squarely at horror movie fans who appreciate the nuances of impalement by pool cue, pencil and table leg. Rodriguez has a lot of fun dreaming up cool ways to kill people (he's making this his life's work), but he also gets something resembling a performance from Tarantino and transforms Clooney into a full-fledged movie star.

Their farm is  on land that the Hudson Bay Company originally cultivated starting in  1821 and now encompasses over 3,000 certified organic acres. They also  are certified \"Salmon Safe\".The Williams organically grow  wheat, alfalfa, hay, alfalfa seed, sweet corn, grain corn, popcorn,  winter squash, and pumpkins. They also have a complete nutrient  recycling program through their dairy replacement livestock feeding  operation. They market directly to Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods and  other regional organic suppliers, including two distilleries, one of  which won an international award for the \"World's Best Vodka\" in 2014. The  Williams Family invites you to visit their farm and discuss the  practice of sustainable agriculture and organic farming. It's really  very simple: all you need is good organic fertility, excellent soil  biology and effective weed control (an impossible task, but they keep  trying to do it). ",

While our events are women focused, our networking series  attracts both men and women to connect.\n\nSignature Networking Events occur the first Thursday of every month. Sign up for the Women Grow newsletter for the most up-to-date information on chapter and national events.\n\n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nWho attends? You'll meet women (and men) at all different\n\nstages of their career in the cannabis industry. Many will be in the research phase, just learning more about opportunities, while still working day jobs. Some are looking for jobs with existing organizations. Others are starting up their own cannabis venture or ancillary business. Depending on the status of legalization in your state, you'll also meet cannabis business owners &amp; investors who are well on their way. Watch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend? Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members. Together we have more power. As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events? We recommend bringing business cards and a pen to take notes. If you don't have business cards, check out Moo for 10% off your first order (and your first order supports Women Grow). Watch our video on networking tips from Women Grow founding members.\n\nWhere are there Women Grow events? Women Grow events are held in small towns and large cities, in prohibition and legalized states alike. No matter where your county is on the road to legalization, you can have a Women Grow chapter. Learn more about starting a Women Grow Chapter.\n\nAre there ID requirements to attend? All attendees must be 21 years or older and have a valid ID as many events occur in establishments serving alcohol.\n\nWhat are my transportation/parking options? We recommend taking public transportation. Street parking is not guaranteed, plan accordingly.\n\nCan I pay at the door? Paying in advance helps speed up our check-in process and makes sure you receive all event announcements. If you are unable to pay in advance, please bring cash.\n\nAre tickets refundable or transferrable? You may send a friend to attend in your place. Tickets are not refundable.\n\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No, as long as your ID matches the name your registered the ticket under. You may also show us your ticket on your mobile device. If you are giving your ticket to a colleague, please forward them the ticket to show us.\n\nAre events on different days other than the first Thursday of the month? Women Grow networking events are on the first Thursday of each month (except for holiday weeks). Social events can be planned at other times. Women Grow's national events are held a few times a year. Make sure you're on the Women Grow mailing list to receive invitations.\n\nWhy do you charge for events? Women Grow is funded by event proceeds and sponsors. We charge for our events so that Women Grow is a self-sustaining organization. If you are unable to afford an event, please contact the organizer to ask about volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy should I consider a career in the cannabis industry? Watch our videos on getting started in the cannabis industry and why women should get involved.\n\nTWITTER TIPS\n\nA great way to connect with fellow participants is to use common hashtags when tweeting about the event. You can use the same hashtags on Facebook. Photos rock. Please share them if you take any!\n\n#WomenGrow #cannabis #womenincannabis #mmj #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis\n",

One that knows what it wants to achieve and does it, flawlessly, artfully and intelligently? If so, then ‘Jaws’ is as good a candidate as any. Thirty-seven years on (and reissued in a new HD print), this tale of an island community terrorised by a killer shark still feels timeless and terrifying. The characterisation is precise and acutely observed (it’s one of the great guys-on-a-mission flicks), the dialogue is witty and wise, and the plot fits together like a finely crafted watch. The performances – not just leads, but the kids, townsfolk and the grief-stricken mother too – are impeccable. Best of all is Steven Spielberg’s direction: the camera moves like a predatory animal, gliding eerily across the surface of the vast Atlantic, creating sequences of almost unbearable suspense (never mind that the scariest scene was shot in a swimming pool). It’s no wonder a generation of holidaymakers still thinks twice before stepping into the water.﻿ -TimeOut\n",

        "description": "Ever learned how to walk in teetering stilettos? Want that shapely behind as you sashay in tall high-heeled shoes? Can you chase down a taxi in your faux Prada pumps? This class will teach you the elusive skill of strutting with confidence, sex appeal, and style. At the conclusion of this class students will be able to choose a shoe style that works for them, understand the impact of high heels on body mechanics, and have an arsenal of strategies to handle walking in heels.  Students should bring two pairs of heels of varying heights (one “high-ish”, one “lower-ish”) in their size to practice in.  Walking up and down stairs may be practiced, weather permitting.",

        "title": "Women Grow Ventura County: Cannabis & Cooking",
        "description": "Women Grow Networking Events connect aspiring and current professionals in the cannabis industry. Through our monthly events, our members develop authentic relationships via personal contact and networking. While our events are women focused, our networking series attracts both men and women to connect.\nSignature Networking Events occur the first Thursday of every month. Sign up for the Women Grow newsletter for the most up-to-date information on chapter and national events.\n\nSPEAKER- CHERI SICARD \n\n\n\nCheri Sicard was a professional food writer and recipe developer long before she became a medical marijuana patient and cannabis cook.  She created the popular cooking website FabulousFoods.com and is the author of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Easy Freezer Meals (2011, Alpha Books), and the editor of the freezer and make ahead cooking blog CheriOnIce.com.  When writing The Cannabis Gourmet Cookbook, she approached marijuana recipe development from the perspective of being a foodie, believing there’s no reason to have to choke down bad tasting or boring edibles in order to receive the benefits of edible cannabis.\n\nHad someone told Cheri back in 1996, when California’s Prop 215 first legalized marijuana for medicinal use, she would become entrenched in the cannabis movement, she wouldn’t have believed them.  Other than the rare toke at a party, Cheri didn’t use marijuana.  It wasn’t until she was nearly 40 years old that her doctor suggested, off the record as the hospital he worked for didn’t “allow” it, she try marijuana to help with a chronic nausea problem that a variety of prescription drugs had failed to help.  It worked immediately.   After regularly using cannabis for a while, Cheri was surprised to discover she no longer felt the need for the anti-depressant prescriptions she’d been taking for years, as for her, cannabis did the job better without unwanted side effects.  Lifelong chronic digestive problems disappeared too.\n\nWhile Cheri marveled at how cannabis had improved the quality of her daily life, she worried that she might somehow be doing herself harm.  Like most Americans, she had been indoctrinated into the school of thought that marijuana is an evil and dangerous drug.  So she started reading and doing research.  She even went so far as to attend and graduate from Oaksterdam University, the cannabis industry’s leading training institution.  Afterwards she continued to attend classes and seminars at every opportunity.\n\nThe more Cheri learned, the more the scientific evidence bowled her over and convinced her that the marijuana she was using not only improved specific symptoms, but overall health and well being as well.  She found it impossible to keep quiet about all the astounding medical research that’s routinely ignored by the mainstream media, and started talking about it to everyone she knew.  She continually found herself outraged by government hypocrisy surrounding the war on drugs and the fact that people all over the county, including in states where the people have voted to make medical marijuana legal, are still being jailed over this benevolent plant.\n\nOver the course of six months Cheri went from the typical closeted American marijuana user to an outspoken cannabis legalization and anti drug war advocate.  And she hasn’t looked back since.  When she isn’t cooking and developing new recipes, you can often find Cheri speaking at civic meetings and city and county councils, organizing rallies, teaching classes, and attending court supports for medical marijuana defendants.\n\nSPONSOR\n\nThank You to our generous sponsor, Grasshopper, Ventura's #1 Medical Delivery, one lucky attendee will be getting a copy of Cheri's book, The Cannabis Gourmet Cookbook!\n\n\n\nEVENT AGENDA\n\n6:30PM Check-in and Open Networking 7:00PM Sponsor Presentation 7:15PM Featured Speaker 7:30PM Book Signing &amp; Open Networking 8:30PM Meeting Concludes\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nWho attends? You'll meet women (and men) at all different stages of their career in the cannabis industry. Many will be in the research phase, just learning more about opportunities, while still working day jobs. Some are looking for jobs with existing organizations. Others are starting up their own cannabis venture or ancillary business. Depending on the status of legalization in your state, you'll also meet cannabis business owners &amp; investors who are well on their way. Watch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend? Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members. Together we have more power. As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events? We recommend bringing business cards and a pen to take notes. If you don't have business cards, check out Moo for 10% off your first order (and your first order supports Women Grow). Watch our video on networking tips from Women Grow founding members.\n\nWhere are there Women Grow events? Women Grow events are held in small towns and large cities, in prohibition and legalized states alike. No matter where your county is on the road to legalization, you can have a Women Grow chapter. Learn more about starting a Women Grow Chapter.\n\nAre there ID requirements to attend? All attendees must be 21 years or older and have a valid ID as many events occur in establishments serving alcohol.\n\nWhat are my transportation/parking options? We recommend taking public transportation. Street parking is not guaranteed, plan accordingly.\n\nCan I pay at the door? Paying in advance helps speed up our check-in process and makes sure you receive all event announcements. If you are unable to pay in advance, please bring cash.\n\nAre tickets refundable or transferrable? You may send a friend to attend in your place. Tickets are not refundable.\n\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No, as long as your ID matches the name your registered the ticket under. You may also show us your ticket on your mobile device. If you are giving your ticket to a colleague, please forward them the ticket to show us.\n\nAre events on different days other than the first Thursday of the month? Women Grow networking events are on the first Thursday of each month (except for holiday weeks). Social events can be planned at other times. Women Grow's national events are held a few times a year. Make sure you're on the Women Grow mailing list to receive invitations.\n\nWhy do you charge for events? Women Grow is funded by event proceeds and sponsors. We charge for our events so that Women Grow is a self-sustaining organization. If you are unable to afford an event, please contact the organizer to ask about volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy should I consider a career in the cannabis industry? Watch our videos on getting started in the cannabis industry and why women should get involved.\n\nTWITTER TIPS\n\nA great way to connect with fellow participants is to use common hashtags when tweeting about the event. You can use the same hashtags on Facebook. Photos rock. Please share them if you take any!\n\n#WomenGrow #cannabis #womenincannabis #mmj #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis\n",

The town Baghdad, Iowa, is an imagined place that is transitional and conceptual. It is a place that connects my personal memories and trauma to an artistic space, which in turn allows both fears and desires to be expressed.

Many will be in the research phase, just learning more about opportunities, while still working day jobs. Some are looking for jobs with existing organizations. Others are starting up their own cannabis venture or ancillary business. Depending on the status of legalization in your state, you'll also meet cannabis business owners &amp; investors who are well on their way.\n\nWatch the video to see for yourself.\n\nWhy should I attend?Personal connections are the key to professional success. Through the wide variety of events offered to members of Women Grow, trustworthy business relationships sprout from the face-to-face interactions of our members.\n\nTogether we have more power.  As the cannabis industry grows on a national and global scale, women have the opportunity to build a new American industry from inception and redefine the workplace to create environments in which we can flourish and define our own destiny, and cultivate the next generation of industry leaders.\n\nHow can I get the most out of networking events?\n\nWe recommend bringing business cards and a pen to take notes. If you don't have business cards, check out Moo.com for 10% off your first order (and your first order supports Women Grow).\n\nWatch our video on networking tips from Women Grow founding members.\n\nWhere are there Women Grow events?Women Grow events are held in small towns and large cities, in prohibition and legalized states alike. No matter where your county is on the road to legalization, you can have a Women Grow chapter.

Make sure you are on the Women Grow mailing list to receive invitations.\n\nWhy do you charge for events?Women Grow is funded by event proceeds and sponsors. We charge for our events so that Women Grow is a self-sustaining organization. Think of your event payment every month as your monthly dues for Women Grow, if you cannot attend a particular month, then you do not pay your dues. If you are unable to afford an event, please contact the organizer to ask about limited volunteer opportunities.\n\nWhy should I consider a career in the cannabis industry?Watch our videos on getting started in the cannabis industry and why women should get involved.\n\n",

After the grandson apparently dies when the ship carrying him back to México sinks in the ocean, the firm’s director (Camil) and a recent recruit (Adriana Louvier) take on the mission of posing as the grandson and his wife. But things get out of hand when the real grandson pops up with demands of his own.Protagonizada por Jaime Camil (“Jane the Virgin”) y ambientada en la década de 1950 en Campeche, “Ilusiones S.A.” gira en torno a una agencia que convierte sus más profundas fantasías, deseos e incluso mentiritas en realidad.

The STEMM role models database will help conference organisers access a diverse and representative group of the most exciting                researchers and developers in their field from around the world.  www.stemmrolemodels.com Gerry McDonnell and Jo Franchetti'I had no idea that this was happening'After our showing of Code - Debugging the Gender Gap. and the discussion that followed, we noticed that one of the common reactions was 'I just had no idea that women faced this kind of adversity'. The film highlighted the online abuse that many high profile women in the technology industry face every day, and as our discussion of the film went on, more people came forward with similar experiences. We'd like to hold a discussion around whether or not the technology industry is an inclusive environment. As such we're going to open the floor to you. Have you ever experienced discrimination or negative treatment at work because of your gender, skin colour, age or disability? What did you do? Was there a resolution? Have you been called out on discriminatory behaviour?

        "description": "Frankie Cosmos w/Eskimeaux, Yowler, &amp; Anna McClellanGreta Kline’s musical output as Frankie Cosmos exemplifies the generation of musicians born out of online self-releasing. Kline initially built a reputation with her prolific catalog of bedroom recordings and as a performer and advocate of New York’s All Ages DIY scene. The beauty in Kline’s writing does not lie within immense statements and large gestures, but instead can be found in her ability to examine situations and relationships with heartbreaking sincerity. In 2014 Kline released her first studio album, Zentropy. Within months of its release, Zentropy became one of the most critically acclaimed independent albums of the year and was named New York Magazine’s #1 Pop album of 2014. In 2015 Kline signed to Bayonet Records, immediately releasing an EP where she experimented with writing in an electronic setting. The EP Fit Me In was well received and garnered a Best New Track from Pitchfork. Kline then began recording her next album appropriately titled, Next Thing. Like Zentropy, Kline approached Next Thing by fleshing out several old home recordings, and by writing half of the album from scratch. Next Thing explores new emotional and instrumental territory for Kline, and is slated for release April 1st on Bayonet Records.",

DOB inspectors regularly visit job sites to check for OSHA cards, and any laborer without an OSHA card will be ejected from the job. Taking this course helps students to remain safety compliant and maintain their current employment or to become safety compliant as a first step towards qualifying to be hired in the construction field.\nOSHA 10-Hour Construction Industry -- Designated Training TopicsThis training program is intended to provide entry level construction workers information about their rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint as well as how to identify, abate, avoid, and prevent job related hazards on a job site. The training covers a variety of construction industry safety and health hazards which a worker may encounter. Training will emphasize hazard identification, avoidance, control, and prevention, not OSHA standards. OSHA mandates that the 10 hours of training be broken into 7 hours of mandatory topics, 2 hours of elective topics, and 1 hour of optional topics as follows:\nMandatory - 7 hoursIntroduction to OSHA -- 2 hoursCovers workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a complaint. It includes helpful worker safety and health resources. It also provides samples of a weekly fatality and 3 catastrophe report, material data safety sheet, and the OSHA Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses.\nFall Hazards in Construction - 1.25 hoursCovers fall protection and related fall hazards encountered on construction sites, including how to remain safe and the proper techniques to establish fall protection.\nElectrical Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers electrical hazards and the dangers involved with working with electrical equipment and circuitry within the construction field.\nStruck By Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourCovers hazards on construction jobsites that relate to falling and flying objects including vehicular strikes. Emphasis is placed on recognizing the hazard and avoiding the hazard.\nCaught-In-Between Hazards in Construction -- 1 hourIncludes hazard awareness of trench collapse, machine guarding, and entrapment situations where workers can be caught in operating machinery or pinched between opposing objects.\nPersonal Protective Equipment -- 1/2 hourCovers the proper, effective use of personal protective equipment (such as hearing protection, safety goggles, and gloves), including statistics of injuries related to the failure to properly use personal protective equipment.\nHazard Communication, Health Hazards, and Silica-- 1 hourCovers the proper way to label and catalogue hazardous materials and chemicals, such as cleaners, solvents, and paint, and how to avoid chronic exposure to hazardous substances including silica.\nElective - 2 hours The instructor will teach two to four of the following topics: Scaffold Hazard AwarenessThis topic covers scaffold hazards including falls, improper usage, improper erection, and the various safety systems to keep workers safe while using scaffolds.\nTrench and Excavation HazardsExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations. This topic introduces learners to the hazards of trench and excavation safety as it is encountered in the construction process.\nConfined Space Hazard IntroductionIntroductory Hazard Training that refers to an area which is enclosed with limited access which makes it dangerous. Hazards in a confined space often include suffocation by un-breathable gases which may be present but not visible or submersion in liquids or free-flowing granular solids.\nLadder SafetyLadder Hazard awareness, including how to properly select, use, and maintain ladders to ensure construction site hazards are minimized.\nRespiratory ProtectionThis topic covers the dangers associated with potential exposure to pathogenic airborne contaminants that can cause acute and chronic diseases among construction workers.\nErgonomicsThis topic teaches how the use of Ergonomics, which is fitting a job to a person, helps lessen muscle fatigue, increase productivity, and reduce the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. \nSafety and Health ProgramThis topic teaches considerations for creating, implementing, and enforcing your own workplace Safety and Health Programs.\nOptional - 1 hour There is also an hour reserved for optional safety training. We can tailor an additional topic to a specific client (such as water safety if the client is a school with a swimming pool), or what most often happens is this hour is reserved for any of the previous topics that the students are particularly engaged in and want to spend more than the allotted time on. It is often helpful for the instructor to have this hour at his or her disposal to be able to devote to any topic in which the students are especially engaged.\n\n",

Realizing there was an opportunity to make an impact in the cannabis industry, Krystal left her 9 to 5, and sought to create a company that brought a fresh approach to canna-business. And that’s how Yummi Karma was born.\n\nFocusing on products that are unique to the market and building a brand that is appealing to women has been the key to Yummi Karma’s success. She also is passionate about playing a role in the political debate surrounding legalization of cannabis and supports organizations that empower women, like Women Grow.\n\nYummi Karma is sponsoring the Lakeside BBQ and Dance at this year's Women Grow Retreat in Lake Tahoe next month, so if you're going, make sure to let Krystal know!\n\nShe believes in being hands-on in her company, and no job is too big or too small. Krystal is always very approachable, so please feel free to ask questions and join the conversation. She truly loves what she does!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A diverse group of innovative intelligence gatherers will tell us how architectural, operational and aesthetic aspects of space can influence wellbeing. We will hear how simple data recording - as well as more illusive impacts – can be turned into valuable intelligence influencing future design, building operation, policy, and development of cities. Buro Happold’s Trevor Keeling will present research using multisensory wearable technology to measure physiological responses to the building environment - some of which was done at the Angel Building. Ines Idzikowski Perez, UCL, will discuss work carried out in AHMM’s Morelands offices studying the relationship between architecture, energy and productivity.

Some of the bands that started out on the college radio circuit became huge, like U2, REM, The Police. Others built giant cult followings like the Violent Femmes, The Replacements, Madness and the Pixies. This month IndieFest celebrates 80s Alt Rock with a play list of some of the hit music videos of 120 Minutes and other fringe music programming of the years between punk and grunge. We know you know all the words, but just in case, we'll have the lyrics on screen for you to sing a long to.The show is all ages. Tickets are $10/advance, $12/at the door.Presented by SF IndieFest and RADIO VALENCIA (radiovalencia.fm)Co-presented by NEW WAVE CITY (newwavecity.com)This show is a benefit event for SF IndieFest and Radio Valencia",

For the brief windows before and after each performance, the space remains open to the public and performers will be available to speak with visitors. Inboxes full of text messages, emails, voicemails, and notifications. People walking into each other, trees and poles on the sidewalk. Headphones in, announcements over loudspeakers, strangers asking for spare change, and signs begging for your business. Is there such a thing as a private moment anymore? Is it even possible to complete a thought without it being interrupted by an entirely different idea? It seems that the potential for withdrawal from these kinds of bombardments is slowly but steadily becoming a thing of the past.Violation Withdrawal is a continuation of the work presented by 5th Digit at Anita's Way in November 2015.About the Company5th Digit Dance, founded by Cassandra Cotta in December, 2015, aims to create athletic, intriguing and relevant material through a highly collaborative process in which each individual performer is viewed as an equal choreographer.Since its founding, 5th Digit has performed all over NYC - at Green Space, the West End Theater and the Old First Reformed Church in Brooklyn. In February, 2016, they were named \"first runners up\" in MTV's \"Dancing with DNCE Contest\" and had a clip of their dance video presented on air. 5th Digit performed a version of Violation Withdrawal as part of the Ruby Slipper Fringe Festival in North Carolina. They are excited to continue their creative process with performances slated for May, 2016 with the Hoover Dam Collective and winter, 2017 in Spoke the Hub's new Gowanus space.About the ChoreographerCassandra Cotta is originally from Point Pleasant, New Jersy. She holds a BFA in modern dance performance from Temple University in Philadelphia and, under the direction of her mentor, Daniel Giel, became a certified Pilates instructor through Sal Anthony's Movement Salon in NYC.She has worked with many different choreographers and companies throughout the NYC and Philadelphia areas including Chrismastersdance, Malcolm Low/Formal Structure, Kun-Yang Lin/Dancers, and Human Architecture.For more information, contact: fifthdigitdance@yahoo.com",

After spending a couple millennia in the ninth circle of Hell, Judas Iscariot’s case is brought before a jury of people awaiting their own judgment. Judas’s final actions on Earth are debated by saints and sinners alike in a trial where saints, apostles, Mother Teresa, Sigmund Freud, Satan, and Christ Himself will all testify. The Last Days of Judas Iscariot is the smart, hilarious, and heartbreaking story of Judas’s ultimate fate. But can a man trapped by his own guilt and despair ever truly be exonerated?",

        "description": "James Flemons was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. When life offered him asthma, he tooled it and fueled it to the discovery of his sister's Barbie sketch designer launching his interest in fashion. In 2012 he graduated with an Associates degree in Product Development from FIDM, and his senior portfolio was used as the platform to base the Senior Product Development Curriculum at all campuses.Flemons to PHLEMUNS, is contemplative and dynamic. Thinking outside the norms of convention and taking to reinvention and recycling. Creating the perfect fluidity of reconstruction of old to new. The use of playing with off proportions is shown throughout his pieces. He achieves a balance of unisex androgyny, classic silhouettes, and the idea of juxtaposition through the process of looking at womenswear and make it masculine for men, and then translating that back into womenswear. With the state of trend driven fast fashion and reselling that we live in today, he strives to create clothing that people will want to hold on to and wear forever.About LA Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2016LAFW is the biggest apparel &amp; design event in California. It's now a permanent feature on the international fashion week circuit alongside London, Paris, Milan, New York, and Tokyo.

After Matt meets Sunny (Alexandra Paul), a call girl involved with powerful drug lord Angel Moldonado (Andy Garcia), he decides that he wants to help her escape the shady underworld. However, Sunny is soon found dead, and Matt tries to win the trust of Angel and his girlfriend, Sarah (Rosanna Arquette), in order to take him down.This screening was made possible thanks to our lovely sponsor Sonic Boom and will be preceded by a mind-shattering pre-show, featuring a curated video mixtape of music, film, and television guaranteed to put you in the right mood.

Event goers and members of the community came together and signed a petition for St. Party’s Day to become a statutory holiday which created a huge buzz around town. 2012, 2013 and 2014 each played host to over 8,000 patrons celebrating the fast growing, authentic Irish holiday, and St. Party’s is back with its partner, Carlsberg, for another year of the best celebrations in the country.**Please enter event during time slot specified.

        "description": "Premiering groundbreaking animations and experimental cinema from across the mainland. Just in time for Chinese New Year, TYPOLOGY is proud to announce our support for CHINA NOW: Independent Visions, in the form of two exciting film screenings we’ll host in Small World Music Centre’s theatre space at Artscape Youngplace this spring!Organized by Toronto-based curator and critic Shelly Kraicer, LA-based producer Karin Chien*, and Chicago-based filmmaker JP Sniadecki, CHINA NOW is the touring arm of Cinema on the Edge, a program of 29 experimental films representing the best of the Beijing Independent Film Festival from 2012-14. Launched to wide acclaim in New York last summer, Cinema on the Edge will debut in Toronto this March with a monthlong program of eight documentaries hosted by TIFF Cinematheque, under the series title The Crisis of the Real: New Chinese Independent Documentaries.Following fast on TIFF's heels, TYPOLOGY will present our own selection from the original series: three groundbreaking animations and one experimental feature which comprise an eye- and ear-opening program of independent contemporary cinema from across China. Featuring filmmakers from Shenyang in the north to Guangzhou in the south, and Tibet in the west to Taiwan in the east, this selection bespeaks volumes on the vastness of space, time scales, and cultural difference experienced by these artists, who must find their voices in a country where censorship remains the order of the day.…And now for the program:CHINA NOW | Selections from Cinema on the Edge, presented by TYPOLOGYThe Animations (3 films, approx 1 hour total screening time)THE HUNTER AND THE SKELETON, 2012 | Dir. BAI BIN | 26 minThis splendid animation of an Eastern Tibetan folk tale is a visually inventive mash-up of traditional Tibetan thangka painting techniques and 80s video arcade game aesthetics. Rendered in Flash with a score that blends native Tibetan music and contemporary sounds, it is an audiovisual delight that goes much deeper — a riveting adventure story with an allegorical twist.FAMILY REUNION, 2012 | Dir. CHEN LI-HUA | 18 minA-mei, an indigenous Taiwanese woman working long hours in a fish processing plant, is called home for the Harvest Festival, but her boss refuses to let her go. Chen’s imaginatively drawn tale is artfully rendered in stop motion style — a moving family portrait with a quirky, storybook feel that has universal appeal.PERFECT CONJUGAL BLISS, 2014 | Dir. ZHONG SU | 5.5 minSurreal and playful, this lusciously rendered animation streams across the screen like a magical river of plenty or a fantastical living scroll emerging and transforming out of the wreckage of a virtual wasteland. Accumulating a hallucinatory visual force which recalls the explosive ending to Antonioni’s Zabriskie Point, Perfect Conjugal Bliss deeply satisfies the eyes even as it questions the origins and implications of humanity’s insatiable desires.The Feature Film (approx 1 hour screening time)YUMEN, 2013 | Dir. HUANG XIANG, JP SNIADECKI, XU RUOTAO | 65 minThis collaboration between two Chinese avant-garde artists and an American experimental filmmaker is a visually stunning ficto-documentary aptly described by curator Shelly Kraicer as a celluloid psycho-collage. Shot on 16mm film, it’s set in the largely abandoned oil town of Yumen in China’s Gansu province near Mongolia. Moving between a barren yet starkly beautiful landscape and what’s left of a city torn by economic collapse and decay, signs of life (or afterlife?) in the form of nameless, wandering characters (ghosts?) perform impromptu, absurd, poignant, or poetic actions and interventions to the sounds of 70s Taiwan pop, contemporary Korean girl bands, and much more. A meditation on survival, this follow-up to Sniadecki’s 2012 film, People’s Park, is an altogether different take on life in contemporary China. Made with the support of Harvard University’s Sensory Ethnography Lab. 16mm-to-digital, in Mandarin Chinese and Gansu dialect with English subtitles.\"Fusing documentary and staged scenes in a manner reminiscent of Godard from the 1970s onward, Yumen brings dignity and beauty to a place that lies in near ruins, and was the finest piece of cinematic portraiture I witnessed at this year’s Berlinale.\"— Travis Jeppesen, Artforum\"When a film like this articulates its setting… a once oil-rich beacon of production in the northwest Gansu province that has since been nearly abandoned — one realizes how few films understand how to create a vivid sense of place…. The monstrous, pulsating rhythm of drilling, the contrastive contours of the landscape, and the lonely group of buildings contained therein. The sound design brings forth a new layer of varying ironies and heartbreak — the very fabric of a broken space.\"— Adam Cook, MubiSniadecki will be in Toronto to introduce his masterful 2012 film, People’s Park, as part of TIFF’s lineup of documentary films from CHINA NOW. Go see it and meet him on March 15 at TIFF, then come watch Yumen, his follow-up to People’s Park, with us!…SCREENING DETAILSThere will be one evening screening  and one daytime screening, each beginning with a brief introduction and closing with a short Q+A:Wednesday, March 30 from 7–9 pm (animations from 7–8, feature from 8–9 + Q&amp;A)Sunday, April 3 from 1–3 pm (animations from 1–2 + kids' Q&amp;A, feature from 2–3)Space is limited; advance ticket purchase recommended — plus save up to $3 per ticket purchased in advance! Advance tickets are available for the full program or each half separately (animations or feature) as follows:$12 for the full program$8 for just the animations (bring the kids! suggested age 5+ / 3 shorts / approx 1hr)or just the feature film (bring the film buff! experimental documentary / approx 1 hr)Limited tickets will be available at the door for $15/full program or $10/half program40% of every ticket sold will go to the featured filmmakers in China.For more information on the films, the filmmakers, and the organizers, visit  www.typology.ca/exhibition/china-now…*Incidentally, Karin Chien is also the producer of UNTITLED (STRUCTURES), 2012 by Leslie Hewitt in collaboration with cinematographer Bradford Young, currently on view as part of the exhibition Collective Stance at The Power Plant through May 15.",

This was the initial push behind Urban Acorn LTD. a Flexiatarian Catering company founded by Chef Daniel Holloway and his parntner Marie Fitrion.Inspired by art, music, and using food as a dialogue for social change, Urban Acorn wants to encourage people to broaden their understanding of food and each other with the hopes of building stronger communities.Their mostly plant-based 'Flexitarian' approach to cuisine, allows them to seemlessly create menus to both omnivores and vegans. Their philosophy is simple, they believe food should unite, not divide people",

On the fringes of sanity, Blanche is trying to forget her checkered past and start life anew. Attracted to Stanley's friend Mitch, she glosses over the less savory incidents in her past, but she soon discovers that she cannot outrun that past, and the stage is set for her final, brutal confrontation with her brother-in-law. (PG-13 Classic Drama)",

Richmond, once the capital of the Confederacy, is the now most liberal city in the state. A melting pot of ideas and stories. Our tattoos are plenty, our bikes are everywhere, and there’s always a festival going on. We may seem scary but that 300-pound bearded gentleman is an amateur opera singer and gives the warmest hugs ever. We never take no for an answer.Virginia Commonwealth University is at the center of this maelstrom of a mixup. We embody the future and study the past. We cause noise complaints and shush others during finals. TEDxVCU is meant to epitomize the spirit of VCU, the contrasts and shades of personalities of the varied people that inhabit our university. We aim to inspire through sharing innovative ideas with the entire community.TEDxVCU serves as a platform for going beyond boundaries. We go to class within walls, bolstered by our own borders between each other. The loneliness of focus begs for interruption, for fresh and new ideas, new horizons of creativity. TEDxVCU seeks to cause a collision of the old and new, bad and good, big and small, in order to reflect upon our communal identity and instill new connection from within and without.To juxtapose is to compare and contrast, to stare long and hard and to glance at in passing. For TEDxVCU this year we want to illustrate the differences and similarities in our community and how we can heal the rifts that break us apart and celebrate the ideas that bring us together.

Change your lifeLEE HARRISwith Meg Fenwick &amp; Steven WashingtonSYDNEY: 16 - 17 JANUARY, 2016MELBOURNE: 23 - 24 JANUARY, 2016The weekend when everything changes for the better...An inner revolution happens when the wounds of the past are finally transformed into gold.   When you are no longer held back from love by old disappointments,   doubts, and fears, your whole life begins to crackle and sparkle with   new energy. When you come face to face with the truth of who you really   are—someone infinitely worthy of love and destined for it—you begin to   breathe more deeply than ever before.You  become a magnet—unable  to push away the closeness, tenderness, and  intimate connection that  WILL transform every part of your life.  Physical health, emotional  well-being, work, finances, family, creative  self-expression, life  purpose—all of these areas and more are infused  with new vision and  possibility.In  a container of great safety, warmth, and humor,  join renowned energy  intuitive and relationship mentor Lee Harris,  along with his  extraordinary co-facilitators, for a weekend of  unexpected and  unimagined magic and change.  WHO THIS WORKSHOP IS FOR…  Whether you are single, in the developmental stages of a relationship,   in a long-term partnership, seeking to bridge the divide in a   relationship, or at any other place along the path of loving, this   workshop will offer uplifting new insights, powerful communication   skills, and the warming light of hope cast over all your relations.  For those already familiar with Lee’s Energy Mastery Retreats,   Revolutionary Love represents the evolution of that profound body of   work—energy mastery applied to loving others and oneself.HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PROCESS INCLUDE: \n\nThe 3 keys to life-changing intimacy — mastering communication, boundaries, and the art of openness\n\nThe gift of conflict — learning how to break through rather than blow up\n\nThe energy of sex — opening to the joy and empowerment of the erotic force.Special note:   We will be approaching this topic from an energetic and emotional   understanding, and with the utmost care, safety, and respect for the   boundaries of each individual and the group as a whole. There will be no   nudity or sexually explicit exercises.\n\n\nThe miracle of self-love — discovering the healing power of being enough\n\nLearn   how to transform the inverted energies that keep relationship patterns   in place. If there is a past relationship you can't get over; a fear   that blocks you from taking risks in love; or shame and self-judgment   that hold you back, deep relief and freedom are your next destination   points along the journey.",

In 2014 he released his first solo album, Shapes That Kiss The Lips Of God, with Cartouche Records out of Davenport, IA.  With a love for the craft of the singer / songwriter and an admiration for artists such as Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen, he tries to write honest songs that feel good and hopefully aren't excessively derivative.

Cosmogyral was devised during her senior year at Woodbury University, where she was required to draft a business plan for a theoretical brand of her own. The plan focused on a resort wear brand that offered lightweight clothing for tropical seasons. Her debut collection, Diaphanous – light, delicate, and translucent – sets the tone to the aesthetic of Cosmogyral. This capsule collection is inspired by evening wear from the Philippines, nature, and the sensuality of lingerie.  Her collections are inspired and revolve around women who like to whirl around the universe in beautiful, experimental clothing. The aesthetic of the collections is a fusion of the designer’s dreams and reality. The designer’s love of romanticism and celestial bodies combined with neoteric fashion give the garments a contemporary, chic vibe. Cosmogyral is designed and produced in Los Angeles. Their goal is to endorse garments made in LA, exhibit that American-made products are high-quality, and promote the luxurious Los Angeles lifestyle.",

What this entails is:1.  We cut the trees down for reasons such as development, disease, mother nature or the end of the trees life2. We salvage the lumber and mill it on our saw mill3. We dry the lumber in our kiln via a wood fired boiler that uses our wood waste as fuel.  The boiler is also piped in to heat our shop4.  Once the lumber is dried and stable we have the capabilities to turn it into a value added product such as furniture, cutting boards, home decor and the list continues.5. We finish the circle by having 2 sizes of tree spades to re-plant trees.We've quickly learned the power of leed credits through our recycling efforts and found a niche in our local market.Some of our Local Willow has gone to a renovation project for Peavy Industries right her in Red Deer.  Local Aspen has been sent to Brewster's in Calgary as casing as the designers wanted something rustic and not the regular go-to douglas fir.  Local Maple bar tops have gone to the District Bar in Medicine Hat.  Furniture has gone to Edmonton.  Live edge slabs have been used as wedding guest sign boards and the list continues.Our goal is to be the best tree company we can be and have a competitive cut about the rest.  We are actively participating in reducing our carbon footprint for our future generations.",

        "description": "#FoBAB is the country’s largest celebration of wood and barrel-aged beers. Brewers around the nation produce craft beers that have been aged in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood to share at our annual #FoBAB event. The general public has access to some of the rarest beers in the world, which may or many not be available commercially from breweries across the country.Over 90 breweries and 300 individual beers will be pouring at tables spread throughout an expanded 24,000 square foot space. Additional tickets for each session will be available this year. Catering services and food trucks will be available for purchase as well.#FoBAB also features a special project called “BarricAle,” which, much like Oak Park Microbrew Review’s “ReplicAle”, gives brewers an opportunity to create barrel-aged beer with only slight variables. Except, unlike ReplicaAle, this time most of the variable comes from the barrel provided, creating amazing, one-off, rare beers! This year’s “BarricAle” project is sponsored by Goose Island. BarricAle features barrel-aged beers from more than 20 Illinois craft breweries. Heaven Hill barrels are the variable this year, as brewers filled empties with their craft beer of choice. Some beers have been sitting for 12 months, 6 months and even at 3 months. Come taste the different nuances of each Illinois hand-crafted barrel-aged beer and find out exactly why they chose to work with the beers they did. The National Wood Aged Beer Competition is judged by a panel of industry experts prior to the public sessions. Each beer is judged on the basis of how that underlying style reflects the expression of wood and/or barrel character. Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals are awarded in 12 categories as well as “Best of Show.”2015 National Wood-Aged Beer Competition (Style Categories):\nPorter/Stout (&lt; 7%ABV) \nStrong Porter/Stout (&gt; 7% ABV)\nSpecialty Strong Porter/Stout (&gt; 7% ABV)\nBarleywine/Wheatwine\nClassic Beer Styles (&gt; 7% ABV)\nStrong Pale Beer (&gt; 7% ABV)\nStrong Dark Beer (&gt; 7% ABV)\nFruit Beer\nSpecialty/Experimental Beer\nWild Beer/Brett (non-acidic)\nWild Beer/Sours (acidic)\nCider/Mead/Perry\nPLEASE NOTE: Tickets go on sale Friday, September 4th at 10AM CST.

In this show, Paul talks about the power and seductiveness of masks while providing uncanny demonstrations of transformation, synchronicity and mindreading.What happens when you are asked to lie? Can you do so successfully or will your face betray you? Can a mask hide the truth?  Would you be willing to risk placing a curse on yourself to save another?  Can a mask actually confer true power on the wearer?  These are but a few of the questions explored in this terrific, interactive show.  Paul will share some very unique antiques and items he has acquired over the years while inviting the audience to take part in creating the performance.The entire audience is invited to attend while wearing masks of some type.  They can choose whether to keep them on and remain hidden or take them off to reveal themselves. The show has a limited number of seats available, so make sure to buy your tickets in advance.  You can get them online or at 109 &amp; Co..  They are $10.00 in advance and $13.00 the day of the show.",

He has written such classics as \"War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning\", \"Days of Destruction Day of Revolt\" and his new book \"Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperatives of Revolt\" which is causing all kinds of interest and controversy. He also has a weekly column at truthdig.com which you can check out HERE! He also has a brand new internet video pod cast called Days of Revolt: Chris Hedges was the Foreign Bureau Chief for the New York Times and covered the Central American Civil Wars, The Revolutions of Eastern Europe in the 1980's, The 1st Gulf War, The disintegration of Yugoslavia, and later moved to France to cover Al Qaeda in North Africa. He has lived in places like the Gaza Strip and has witnessed the true horrors the Palestinian people are faced with between the Authataurianism of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the ineffectiveness of Palestinian authority, to the under reported suffering and oppression Israel causes through blockades, occasional invasions, violent reactions to protests, indiscriminate bombings and harassment (like flying Israeli Military Jets over residential areas at 3 am in the morning). Chris left the New York Times, a paper with an unofficial motto \"Do not alienate our donors (leisure class) too much\", around the time of the initial invasion of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq: Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) I mean Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was scheduled to make a commencement speech at Rockford College as a stage to denounce the invasion of Iraq.He as booed off stage and his mic was cut off twice... There was such a reaction to his speech at this College that the New York Times gave Chris an official warning to stop criticizing the Iraq war or he would be fired. He did not want to betray the ethics that his father instilled in him, who was a pastor, so he quit and shortly after released the book \"War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning\" which was an non-chonologically organized book that talks about the horrors of Warfare and is a critical look about how violence, even if it is necessary, is a something that will poison us and that critique is used to analysis the war and violence of American society. Chris was there in the early days of the Occupy Wall Street Movement and became one of its most visible faces and voice. He and Cornel West put Wall Street on trail and was arrested outside of Goldman Sachs.Watch It Here:Chris was featured in one of Michael Moore's films \"Capitalism: A Love Story\"His new book called Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt. It is book that delves into the history of some critical revolutions and the leaders who uplifting the masses to rebel against the structures of power that had decay to such a state to cause people no longer accept a status quo that people so easily previously accepted as the natural order of things. Here is a panel of Chris Hedges, Cornel West, and Richard Wolff: How do you kick off a revolution? Chris over the years has been a strong advocate for \"F***ing Up The System\" as he called it when he addressed a Green Party in New Jersey in 2013. The video is a critique of the Green Party is that electoral politics should be a tangential element of the activities of the party's business while it should be a party of activism or at a very minimum a support group that can provide logistical support for supplying protesters with food and other materials they need to maintain their activities... A criticism the GPOC has taken seriously as we have realized that our party has been playing by the rules of system not designed for them on the State and National level but with the acknowledgment that there is a lot of potential on the local level. This includes blocking vehicles with roadblocks that are trying to frack your communities, occupying police stations, organizing prisoners who more than half are in prison for non violent drug offenses and are mainly black and latino to do hunger strikes/ stop working for companies(while in prison) that pay a wage comparable to wages paid to 8 year old Chinese factory workers, boycotting and divesting in institutions that support despotic regimes or countries like the Israeli Apartheid State, running for local political office like Ksama Sawant and shaking things up on the local level, Public Banking to replace the rapacious vampires  of Wall Street, and just starting to look into Alternatives all together because what we have now is not sustainable and if there are no alternatives proposed the Tinder box we call America is going to catch fire like the once unbothered Arctic Forests have been due to climate change.  Heed the Call Orange County. TIME TO THROW SOME WRENCHES INTO THE MACHINE.Also to understand the what Chris Hedges has been saying from a local context/perspective it is best to look at the Anaheim Police Department's extrajudicial killing of Manuel Diaz in the Summer of 2012 and how the police handled themselves afterwards... It is a common pattern around the country. So they already know how this is going to play out... the question is do you?\nWhen a group of concern citizens started inquiring about the death of their neighbor Manuel Diaz the police of Anaheim had quite a reprisal for them. These are, in what Chris Hedges says, are brushfires that are breaking out and are being extinguished. Other Key examples Occupy Wall Street/The Marches on Ferguson, The Baltimore Riots, etc. The current conditions that exist to create right wing movements like the Tea Party, but since the grievances of many of these people are not being addressed: The public Bail Out of Wall Street and massive losses of property(their savings and homes) of many American citizens, The maimed veterans who are coming back realizing they are not fighting legal wars to the benefit of a handful of major companies (Dick Cheney's Haliburton stock price has quadrupled since before the invasion of Iraq) and are not being taken care of by Uncle Sam, People of minority communities are having members of their community lock away in prison for non-violent drug offense(by in large), America has lost around 60,000 major factories that has turned the countries inner economic core into an abandoned shell of its former self and has pitted the Cheap Labor of the 3rd World against the lowering wages of American workers and even the wage slavery/state sanction chattel in our own prison system which makes up of 25% of the world population of prisoners. The elite class knows this... they have designed this... and as a result they are passing laws or adding to laws like to the NDAA section 1021 and 1022 where it will be legal for the military to detain American citizens indefinitely... no habeaus corpus. Chris Hedges Sued Obama in Obama vs. Hedges and won in a lower court but it was thrown out because they ruled that Hedges had no standing... regardless if this would be a wonderful tool to disappear journalists just like Mr. Hedges who spends his time challenging the narrative our puppet leaders would have us believe. So the gun powder has outgrown the powder kegs and is all over the ammunition room... and we don't know when the start of this will ignite... but one this is for sure... the clock is ticking. Many of the conflicts and/or \"brushfires\" we are seeing today are is the beginning of the conflicts that we are going to see for the next century. It is on.  Chris Hedges Interview of Julian Assange:Written Version:Verbal Version:So they already know how this is going to play out... the question is do you?Jill SteinJill Stein is the Green Party Presidential Candidate for 2016. She was also for 2012.In 2012 She was arrested because she and her running mate Cheri Honkala for trying to enter a presidential debate. http://www.rt.com/usa/police-jill-stein-debate-589/Her Presidential Candidacy raises bigger questions for our Democracy as a whole. Do we as Americans actually get represented, our interests and values, during a Presidential campaign? We have a two party system and both parties are coalitions are several different interest group that are sometimes at odds with each other that have been bought out by economic interest group and it is a winner take all system. Even in places like Turkey, a country with Democratic organs, they even have a this thing called proportional democracy. The HDP won 13% and they are \"attempting\" to form a coalition government.  Our republic is very disproportionate in its representation of its people and on top of that it is bought out by more and more money thanks to the Citizen's United Decision which is exasperating these issues even further.One of Jill Stein's major policy pieces is her \"Green New Deal\" which is a Green version of FDR New Deal on how to stabilize the economy for the masses of people. Gayle McLaughlinGayle McLaughlin is the former Green Party Mayor of Richmond, CA. (The Bay Area). She made national headlines when after the housing crisis causes all kind of mayhem for the economy and non 1% America and especially the worker class her city had a crisis on her hands... Hundreds on families were loosing their homes. Many of these families were also paying 2-3 times more than the house was actually worth... all these homes were clearly underwater. So her plan was to use Eminent Domain, which is traditionally famous usually for how governments collude with private interests to force people to sell their property for \"Fair Market Value\" for the \"good of the community\" only to be used by commercial interests- like for making room for oil and gas pipelines through rural and suburban America though it also used appropriately in many cases like making room for Freeways, to be fair. \"Under Richmond's plan, the city would seize the mortgage—but not the home—with backing from a private firm. They would then reduce the loan principal and refinance into a new government-guaranteed loan. That would leave the borrower with a fixed payment and less debt.\"Novel Use of Emminent DomainHere is Gayle on Bill Moyers &amp; Company:  _______________________________________________________________________________Notes from Event Producer:When I threw an event with Dr. Richard Wolff in February of 2015 I was told by everyone that only 30 people would show up for the event. Even KPFK who drove Dr. Richard Wolff to the event said that only 30 people would show up because this is Orange County but when they showed up there eyes were wide open in amazement to the fact that there were 400 people sitting down in a room, after only 12 days of promoting the event, all to hear what the Marxian Economist had to say. What was said here is that Orange County is not what it used to be.The numbers also point to the fact that 90% of the online ticket sales were from people living in Orange County. The same will be true for this event. ",

        "description": "Driftwood Theatre proudly presents Hamlet, the world’s most famous play, like you’ve never seen it before. On stage outdoors in communities across Ontario, July 9 - August 16, 2015. The summer tour will feature a thrilling new adaptation by dramaturg Toby Malone that is unpredictable, unsettling and downright dangerous - Hamlet with the brakes off. This electrifying revenge-thriller pits one man against the world around him as he sacrifices everything and everyone he loves to avenge his father’s murder.Young Hamlet’s world is turned upside down when, after the death of his father, his mother quickly marries Hamlet’s uncle Claudius. When the ghost of Hamlet’s father appears before him to accuse Claudius of murder, Hamlet is set upon a course of action which will have significant consequences for everyone that he holds dear. Hamlet is gripping tragedy fueled by grief and framed by a world dominated by the politics of fear.Both newcomers to Hamlet and Shakespeare aficionados will delight in this version; a perfect match for Driftwood’s inventive theatrical style and our magical outdoor settings.",

Four controversial and seemingly isolated stories interlock as the characters battle their own personal demons, as well as the burdens that society places on them. A young man deals with haunted nightmares of his abusive family past that seem to arise in his present. The story heightens as a Hispanic family deals with their father figure’s three year deployment to Iraq while coping with his absence in destructive ways. Dive into a complex, interracial religious family, whose faith is tested when dealt sexual tragedies and shocking truths.

Starring Japanese indie icon Tadanobu Asano (Ichi the Killer) and one of Mexico’s best new actresses Nathalia Acevedo (Post Tenebras Lux), Ruined Heart defies easy explanation. The basic plot is simple: Asano’s gangster rescues Acevedo’s whore and they go on the run. Along the way there is a Godfather (poet-playwright Vim Nadera) who is “the world’s poem,” dance parties, dream parades and carnivals, orgies, and murder. All of this is accompanied by wild visuals and an even wilder soundtrack. Acevedo’s exuberant acting and eye-popping costumes and Asano’s raw physicality (sequences where he runs through the back alleys holding the camera are some of the most striking in recent cinematic memory) create an emotional core to the action that gives the chaos a joyful tenderness that stays with the viewer long after the film is over.",

        "description": "By Yasmina RezaOne of Marc's best friends, Serge, has just bought a very expensive painting. It's about five feet by four, all white with white diagonal lines. To Marc, the painting is a joke, but Serge insists Marc doesn't have the proper standard to judge the work. Another friend, Ivan, though burdened by his own problems, allows himself to be pulled into this disagreement. Lines are drawn and these old friends square off over the canvas, using it as an excuse to relentlessly batter one another over various failures. As their arguments become less theoretical and more personal, they border on destroying their friendships. Directed by Keone Fuqua",

        "description": "Only one thing is for sure. At 4 pm on Saturday, May 23 at the Fresno Art Museum, no one knows what is going to happen. That's the beauty of art (and music) that is based on improvisation. “When Art Meets Jazz” is not the typical art show or jazz concert. Rather than displaying their work while a jazz trio plays softly in the background and the audience sips chardonnay and nibbles on cheese, seven amazing Valley artists will begin with a blank canvas - literally. As the show begins, they will draw their inspiration from the improvised music of many of the Valley's best jazz musicians and the atmosphere of the event itself and create work on the spot. The event will feature two stages: inside the museum's Bonner Auditorium and outside in the Sculpture Garden. The early hours of the event will feature the five ensembles of the Milestones Youth Jazz Workshop, student musicians from 18 schools who study weekly with four acclaimed Valley jazz educators.    At 7 pm, a collection of the Valley’s best jazz pros will take to the stage. Accompanying the musicians will be notable local artists who will follow no rules except to be inspired by the sights, sounds and rhythm of the event. The event will also include a silent auction, no-host cocktails and local  food trucks. The work created by the professional artists, in fact, will also be up for bid – before it is created – bringing yet another new twist to the event. Participating local artists include Leslie Batty, Bill Bruce, Yuliya Gasio, Chris Janzen, Garrett Masterson,  Will Portis and Anne Scheid. Participating musicians include Eva Scow and Espacio, the Tim Shaghoian Trio (with Spee Kosloff and Nate Guzman), the Richard Giddens Trio (with Tom Wilson and Brian Hamada), the Ayala-Lewis Quintet (featuring John Ayala, Joe Lewis, David Aus, Kevin Hill and Joe Lizama), and the Fresno City College Faculty Some-tet.

        "description": "Forces acting within the Earth, generally unseen by humans, manifest themselves in awesome displays of fiery power. Vulcão is Contempo Physical Dance’s latest collaboration between choreographer Marciano Silva dos Santos, composer Divanir Antonio Gattamorta, and its unified and fiercely athletic cast of dancers. Utilizing the company’s Afro-Brazilian contemporary dance fusion, the work takes inspiration from volcanoes, which are both majestically beautiful and powerfully dynamic. Also slang in Brazilian Portuguese to describe someone extremely desirable or detested, Vulcão goes beyond nature to reveal parallels found in human relationships. From shifting tectonic plates to fluid and viscous lava, the work pushes the dancers’ physicality and displays their unyielding vitality. In addition to the world premiere of Vulcão, Contempo Physical Dance will perform excerpts from Batuque, a memorable favorite from the company’s repertoire exploring the flavors of samba. Join us at Macalester College this May for Contempo Physical Dance’s Saint Paul debut performance.“This  activity is made possible by the voters of Minnesota through a grant  from the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council, thanks to a legislative  appropriation from the arts and cultural heritage fund.”",

Yet, as our technological capabilities evolve at an almost alarming rate, culture is simultaneously overrun with nostalgia-soaked revivals and the mimicking of styles and looks from nearly every decade pre-2000.In  the wake of sometimes feeling like we may be running out  of new ideas,  perhaps it is time to ask some questions: what exactly  are we producing;  how are we producing it; and why are we producing so  much of it?We hope you can join us for an engaging session and to mingle with fellow art and culture enthusiasts over a light dinner.Love,TSC TeamThe Social Collective is brought to you by Bazaar Marketing &amp; Communications Inc.",

        "description": "Stu&amp;Jess Productions has made it their mission to present talented,  young singers in unique, non-traditional venues. \"L'Heure Espagnole\"  marks the third collaboration of Stuart Martin and Jessica Derventzis,  the creative team behind Stu&amp;Jess Productions, their first success  having been with Gian Carlo Menotti's \"The Medium\" in the fall of 2013,  which was presented in a re-envisioned church. Their production Ravel's  comedic classic will be given a modern twist, housed in the upper floor  warehouse of the Techno-Lith paper company in Montreal.Ravel's classic \"L'Heure Espagnole\" It is the clockmaker          Torquemada's day to regulate the municipal clocks, and consequently, it is wife Concepción's          day to entertain her lover. When Ramiro, a muleteer, visits the clockshop          to have his watch repaired, Concepción worries that his presence will          ruin her rendezvous with the poet Gonzalve. To distract Ramiro, Concepción          asks him to carry out various tasks. Another suitor, Don Inigo, arrives,          and a hilarious attempt to hide the lovers from each other and smuggle          each of them to her bedroom without Ramiro noticing ensues. Finally, Concepción--weary          of her suitors' antics--exits with the virile muleteer. Torquemada returns, delighted to see so many eager customers with his wife. This opera is performed in French with English subtitles and runs just under an hour. This production is made possible by a grant from \"Dandy Andy Award for Performance Arts\" from the Main &amp; Station Nonesuch. CAST:Stage Director: Jessica DerventzisConductor: Stuart MartinStage Manager: Samantha PickettFeaturing the Stu&amp;Jess OrchestraRamiro: Dimitri KatotakisTorquemada: Lee ClappConcepción: Charlotte GagnonGonzalve: John CookDon Inigo: Russell WustenbergTickets: $20 for children, seniors, students and arts workers               $25 for adultsOption for donations to Stu and Jess Productions with ticket purchase!Due to the nature of the venue, it is not handicap accessible.For all ticket and production inquiries, please call 5147096834 OR 4162763241 and NOT the Techno-Lith StudioWhere to go: The entrance of Techno-Lith LTD is at 141 Rue Ann.

Et chaque jeudi, Concepción reçoit la visite de son amant poète, pendant que son horloger de mari, Torquemada, s'occupe des horloges municipales. Mais la présence intempestive d'un financier amoureux et d'un muletier têtu compromet son rendez-vous hebdomadaire. Force lui serait de rester sage si le vigoureux muletier, venu faire réparer sa montre, ne profitait de la situation...Cet opéra sera chanté en français avec sous-titres anglais et dure un peu moins d’une heure.

When she casts an evil spell, each sister is catapulted into her  own fractured fairytale -- Rapunzel craves junk food, Cinderella has  self-esteem issues, Snow White is allergic to apples, and each dreams of  being rescued by a handsome Prince.Beau,  Barry, and Burly Bob may be a little more bashful and bumbling than  bright, but with the help of the Fairy Tailor and a little magic, they  all live happily ever after!  Written by June Rachelson-Ospa and Daniel NeidenDirected by Daniel NeidenRunning time: 60 mins.\"Great songs, great comedy, and the best singing you'll hear on or off Broadway.\" ~ Mike Reiss, Writer for #TheSimpsons“Rapunzarella White is everything a kids show should be: Colorful, fun, inclusive, and totally delightful! It is  a clever spin on three fairy tales that all of us know and love. Plus,  the music and lyrics are smart and sharply performed by a talented group  of actors.”~ Jack Hyman, Author of \"Breakfast with the Birds\"“It's better than the Spongebob movie!”~ Sofia L., age 6\"...there  is nothing kids love more than being silly!  RAPUNZARELLA WHITE is  wonderful.  These marvelous actors totally connect with the whole  family.”~ Frances Breuer, Pre-school teacher“…an unabashed joy!  Terrific music, an adorably sassy script, and zingers that keep parents laughing along.”~ Bruce Kluger, Contributing Editor, Parenting Magazine\"My daughter and I saw Rapunzarella White this weekend and loved it! She walked out and immediately said she wanted to see it again. This is the first time she's felt that way about a show....It really felt like the kind of show I saw and loved as a kid. Not so easy to find anymore.\"~ Vivian Connolly, a NYC mom“It’s a total delight!” ~ Mary McCormack, Tony Award-winning actress from Broadway's BOEING-BOEING",

With 50 Craft Breweries and 12 Food Trucks, we’re working to make it even better this year.One Hundred Percent of the net proceeds from the festival go directly to Food Bank for Larimer County. In 2014, with a staff of 34 and over 2,400 volunteers, Food Bank provided more than 8.9 million pounds of food to thousands of people who struggle each day to feed themselves and their families.

This webinar will consider these questions and what we might be able to do to restore balance. Mariana will share some tools for talking to parents, educators and others about the importance of risk taking, and will provide an example from her research showing the effects of good play space design on children’s behaviour. Dr. Mariana Brussoni is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia and with the British Columbia Injury Research &amp; Prevention Unit.

It was there that Jodorowsky underwent an unhappy and alienated childhood as part of an uprooted family. Blending his personal history with metaphor, mythology and poetry, The Dance of Reality reflects Jodorowsky's philosophy that reality is not objective but rather a \"dance\" created by our own imaginations.Gala reception:Based on the belief that quality food and drink can transform the spiritual well-being, Fonda Lola showcases Mexican food beyond fish tacos and enchiladas, in an authentic atmosphere.http://www.fondalola.ca942 Queen St. W,Toronto, ON, M6J 1G8",

Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) escapes the tedium of a desk job to join Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy (DeForest Kelley) on another space mission. While boldly going where no man etc. etc., Kirk crosses the path of his old enemy Khan (Ricardo Montalban), who as any die-hard fan knows, was the villain in the 1967 episode \"Space Seed.\" Leading a crew of near-savage space prisoners, Khan insinuates himself into the Genesis Project, which is designed to introduce living organisms on long-dead planets. Intending to harness this program for his own sinister purposes, Khan engages in battle with the Enterprise crew.We will be presenting this special screening of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in memory and honour of the inimitable Leonard Nimoy. May his memory live long and prosper. Join us, and say it loud for Mr. Spock. KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNN!See Trailer HERE.",

Event goers and members of the community came together and signed a petition for St. Party’s Day to become a statutory holiday which created a huge buzz around town. 2012, 2013 and 2014 each played host to over 8,000 patrons celebrating the fast growing, authentic Irish holiday, and St. Party’s is back with its partner, Carlsberg, for another year of the best celebrations in the country.**Please enter event during time slot specified.

You're invited to look deep within yourselves to find the beast lurking just beneath your civilized surface.

However, once the hour is witching, we will be switching gears and turning the event into an all night raging animal dance party. From 12am to 5am, DJ Atomstaub will be spinning the froggiest techno tunes and the foxiest jungle jams. Come hop the night away with The Poetry Brothel for our second-ever show in Paris. What can we say loves, we just can't stay away.Doors open at 8pm. The show begins promptly at 9pm. Tickets are €15 online (€14 if you share the event on Facebook/Twitter) or €20 at the door. The price of admission includes one free drink. Special thanks to our partners, Le Fabuleux Cabinet des Curiosites and We Love Words. About The Poetry Brothel:The Poetry Brothel is an interactive poetry experience set up as a decadent fin de siècle brothel.  Poets performing under pseudonyms offer private, one-on-one poetry readings of their original  work in candlelit back rooms…for money. Of course, any true brothel needs a good cover; The Poetry Brothel’s is an immersive cabaret, offering a full bar, musicians, burlesque dancers, painters, actors, and fortune-tellers, with newly integrated themes, performances and installations at each event. ___Très chers chats et chatons, dogues et pinsons, venez à toutes ailes ou à toutes pattes, courez, marchez ou rampez au tout premier Bestiaire du Bordel de la Poésie, à Paris, le 6 Mars! Le Bordel de la Poésie permettra à ses Putains Poètes de renommée mondiale de vivre leur vraie nature animale le temps d'une nuit. Vous êtes invités à trouver la bête qui sommeille juste en-dessous de votre surface civilisée. Alors arborez fièrement griffes, crocs et plumes, et joignez-vous à nous pour un extraordinaire Bestiaire du Bordel de la Poésie en deux parties. En première partie de soirée, le chemin d'Apollinaire et de Baudelaire croisera celui du burlesque bestial de Sucre d’Orge, Soa de Muse, et Velena Rossa et de l'électro swing de DJ Elo et, bien entendu, vos Putains Poètes favoris dans toute leur majesté animale proposeront des lectures privées. La croisée de la nuit et du matin, quant à elle, sera pure danse animale endiablée. De minuit à cinq heures, DJ Atomstaub jouera ses tons technos les plus mordants et autres morceaux musicaux à se lécher les babines. Venez hurler à la lune avec le Bordel de la Poésie pour notre deuxième événement à Paris. Que voulez vous mes chéris, nous sommes conquis.Ouverture des portes à 20h. Les représentations commencent à 21h. Les tickets coûtent 15€ en ligne (14€ si vous partagez l'évènement sur Facebook ou Twitter), et 20€ sur place. L'entrée inclut une boisson offerte. Un merci spécial à nos partenaires, Le Fabuleux Cabinet des Curiosites et We Love Words.Au sujet du Bordel de la Poésie:Le Bordel de la Poésie est un évènement poétique unique et immersif qui sort la poésie des salles de classes et des amphis et la place dans le cadre décadant d'une maison close. Inspiré dans son concept par les bordels de la Nouvelle Orléans et de Paris à la Belle Epoque, nombre desquels servaient de refuge pour des artistes méconnus d'avant-garde, la \"Maquerelle\" du Bordel de la Poésie présente une troupe toujours en évolution de poètes en tant que \"putains\", qui règlent leurs actions sur un personnage soigneusement construit et partagent leur œuvres dans des lectures publiques, des éruptions spontanées de poésie et - c'est là l'essentiel - en tant que fournisseurs de lectures privées, individuelles, dans des arrière-salles. En échange d'une petite rétribution, touts les \"putains poètes\" peuvent être engagés pour une lecture privée à tout moment au cours de l'évènement. Evidemment, tout vrai bordel a besoin d'une bonne couverture; celui du Bordel de la Poésie est d'être un cabaret immersif proposant un bar complet, du jazz live, des danseurs de burlesque, des peintres et des diseurs de bonne aventure, avec de nouveaux thèmes, spectacles et installations à chaque évènement.",

        "description": "Fifth film in Bright Nights: the 5th Annual Baltic-Nordic Film Festival dir. Zaida BergrothFinland, 2011, 88 minutes Finnish with English sub-titles  Bergroth’s second feature film is a black comedy with sinister undertones, revolving around a psychologically troubling relationship between a profoundly diva-ish film star mother and her teenage son. Leila (Elina Knihtilä), a middle-aged and profoundly narcissistic actress, is constantly surrounded by scandal. Vain and demanding, she’s relied on her oldest son Illmari (Samuli Niittymäki) for everything from career and emotional support to housekeeping duties. Taking Illmari and his little brother with her on a weekend “break” to their lakeside cabin, a bored Leila invites a drunken coterie of friends and sycophants to join them. Enter screenwriter Aimo (Eero Aho), who immediately catches Leila’s eye. Illmari is not amused. Tension mounts. “Bergroth treads a fine line, offering up, on the one hand, a devastating satire of showbiz life and, on the other, a serious drama about a psychologically damaged youth. This rare thematic coupling is as unsettling as it is richly satisfying.” Palm Springs International Film Festival. ",

So join us in a series where we look at some of the most fabled and loved regions and wines around the world. But these amazing wines are not always accessible. So we have found the best way to try them is as a group! A small group that can taste, ask questions, learn, argue and laugh. And as our tastes and learning shifts, we will let the group decide what region or wine we explore next. Wine for the people, by the people! “Too much of anything is bad, but too much Champagne is just right”  -Mark TwainEpisode #3: Champagne: Grower v House We will taste six (6) Champagnes highlighting the differences between House and Grower Champagnes. Nothing stirs excitement and lore like Champagne. Perhaps it is the bubbles. Perhaps it is the mystique of name. Perhaps it is the high prices? Regardless, we love Champagne. We will thoroughly explore the region, its history with royalty, war and trademark issues with other sparkling regions. We will learn about Dom Perignon, the widow Clicquot and the laborious steps needed to make Champagne. The tasting will include examples of Grower Champagne (grapes are grown and vinified by the producer) and House/Negociant Champagne (grapes are purchased to produce a house-style sparkling). This will be another fun and informative tasting of one of the most celebrated, and celebratory, wines. If there are any of the wines that stand out, we can special order these for you!

There is something familiar in the accomplished handling of dark themes, the dead-eyed vow to avenge a sibling’s death, the crackling danger that permeates every scene – and yet the variations are what elevate this tale and let you know you’re watching something truly special.  Damn. - Drea Clark, Programmer &amp; Co-CaptainPlaying with short film:The Tide KeeperOne night an old seaman dreams the ocean into his bed.

        "description": "&gt;&gt;&gt; Band &amp; Director in Attendance!!! &lt;&lt;&lt;The story of Canadian dance-punk band, Death From Above 1979, and how the power of music shaped their tumultuous decade-long friendship.In 2001, after years of playing together in various bands, living together, and bonding over a mutual desire to continue playing music while peers abandoned rock n' roll to follow more traditional career paths, Jesse Keeler (bass) and Sebastien Grainger (drums), started a band out of boredom and necessity. They hammered out their sound in an unfinished basement in the east end of Toronto, and the result is what many have described as \"an elephant in your living room.\"They were propelled into the limelight based on the strength of their raucous live performances and the release of their seminal album, You're a Woman, I'm a Machine (2004). But as the band's success grew internationally, their friendship became strained due to constant travel, and little-to-no buffer between them. Over the course of grueling schedules and never-ending tours, they broke up in 2006, right after the biggest tour of their careers, and ended the band before reaching potential stardom.In 2011, after five years of silence between them, and each focused on their own musical projects and respective lives, Jesse and Sebastien decided to reunite for one show: the legendary Coachella Music and Arts Festival. Life After Death From Above 1979 tells the story their rise, break-up, and coming back from the dead.Featuring music by Death From Above 1979, MSTRKRFT, Sebastian Grainger &amp; The Mountains, Femme Fatale, CSS &amp; more, and iinterviews with members of Death From Above 1979, Justice, MSTRKRFT, The Strokes, Metric, Yeah Yeah Yeah’s &amp; more",

While planning the military maneuvers of the Warsaw Pact forces, Polish army colonel Ryszard Kuklinski has access to top secrets. He is also increasingly haunted by Poland’s forced participation in the repressive and violent events that took place in Czechoslovakia and the Baltic States under Soviet control. In the 1970s, Kuklinski decides to rebel. He starts a long, lonely and psychologically exhausting cooperation with CIA as a double agent. From that very moment the life of his family and his own is in constant danger:  one careless move may lead to catastrophe.

Il apprend que les Américains prévoient exécuter une contre-attaque nucléaire contre les forces soviétiques en sol polonais. Déterminé, il entame une longue, solitaire et épuisante coopération avec le CIA. Sa vie et celles des membres de sa famille sont dès lors menacées : un faux pas, et c'est la catastrophe.

Needless to say, it was a pretty festive evening from top to bottom, so this year we’re going one step further by joining forces for this transcultural party at Remix Lounge featuring New York’s DJ Ushka in her Canadian debut alongside the infamous Poirier from Montreal. Expect digital ecstasy and a few surprises. feat.DJ Ushka (NYC) El Poirier (Montreal) + Special surprise guestsCustom Visuals by Bá Land DJ Ushka (NYC) http://www.djushka.com/Ushka is a Sri Lankan-born, Thailand-raised, Brooklyn-living migrant. She is an activist, cultural organizer, and deejay re-defining the boundaries of global bass music and culture.Having grown up in several parts of the world, her musical influences are as transnational as she is. She deejays from the perspective of a dancer, blending a wide range of music from soca to cumbia, hip hop to South Asian rhythms, kuduro and other African styles to samba. She does so with the philosophy that global genre-blending connects cross-cultural struggles and tells important stories between communities but most importantly, she translates this onto dancefloors.Poirier (Montreal) http://poiriersound.com/Poirieris Montreal’s pre-eminent Tropical Bass producer. Pinpointing the bits and pieces of dancehall beats, soca energy and electronic intensity is futile in the face of Poirier’s dance-driven creativity and air horn-worthy excitement. He has been nominated for a couple of Junos in his time. This is a man who just understands what works in the dance. He’s released several acclaimed albums on Ninja Tune, remixed the likes of Busy Signal, Salif Keita and Pole and has toured the world several times over. In 2013 Poirier embarked on a new mission: the “chamber techno” music of Boundary. This alias was responsible for one of the remixes in the Music Gallery’s Hugh Le Caine project last year.Remix Lounge, 1305 Dundas W,Doors 10 p.m.Co-presented with X Avant IX: Transculturalism (The Music Gallery) Tickets: 12 advance. ",

        "description": "The Vibrant Voice Technique is a revolutionary approach to enhancing your voice. The simple (and surprising) idea: use a vibrator.\n\nAfter all, what do the vocal folds do? They vibrate. What is resonance? It is sympathetic vibration. The Technique uses a small, hand-held vibrator and a series of exercise targeting the head, neck, and shoulders. The goal is to enhance your vocal resonance and help you reduce the muscle tension that can lead to vocal fatigue. In other words, the goal is more sound with less work.\n\nThe Online Workshop\n\nThe workshop occurs across two days of instruction separated by a week of practice and implementation time:\n\nDay 1: Sunday July 31st from 1pm-3:30pm mountain time (12pm PST/3pm EST)\n\nDay 2: Sunday August 14th from 1pm-3:30pm mountain time (12pm PST/3pm EST)\n\nIdeally, you'll want to make yourself available for both days of the workshop as Day 2's learning will build upon Day 1's lesson and questions will be addressed on both days. However if you cannot make it to some portion of the workshop, a recording will be made available to all those enrolled. Please note the workshop size is limited to provide ample opportunity for participants to ask questions and receive personal feedback.\n\nThe workshop will be led by the Vibrant Voice team: David Ley and Elissa Weinzimmer.\n\nWho is the workshop for?: If you rely on your voice, this technique can help you. So whether you're a school teacher, a professional singer, or anything in between, this workshop is for you.\n\nWhat you'll need: Your computer with a camera and microphone and the ability to download some simple software (www.zoom.us) and your own vibration device (if you don't have one yet, you can get one here: vibrantvoicetechnique.com/faqs/)\n\nWorkshop fee: $250 CAD ($195 early registration by July 16th at 10pm mountain)\n\nYour workshop fee also includes: Online access to the video recordings of the workshop sessions, a copy of the Vibrant Voice Technique How To Guide (only available to those who have participated in a training), monthly access to our live online refresher sessions, and membership in the Vibrant Voice Technique Facebook Forum.\n\n(If you prefer to pay in US dollars please send us an email and we will send you a separate invoice)\n\n*please note that there are no refunds\n\nWant to know more about Vibrant Voice Technique?

Box office opens at 7:30 pm on the night of the event.Director: Steven KnightGenre: DramaRunning Time: 85 minutesRating: 14AStarring: Tom HardySynopsis: Ivan Locke (Hardy) has worked diligently to craft the life he has envisioned, dedicating himself to the job that he loves and the family he adores. On the eve of the biggest challenge of his career, Ivan receives a phone call that sets in motion a series of events that will unravel his family, job, and soul. All taking place over the course of one absolutely riveting car ride, LOCKE is an exploration of how one decision can lead to the complete collapse of a life. Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Knight (EASTERN PROMISES, DIRTY PRETTY THINGS) and driven by an unforgettable performance by Tom Hardy, LOCKE is a thrillingly unique cinematic experience of a man fighting to salvage all that is important to him.Watch the Trailer:Music Performance By: WeavesWeaves is a guerrilla project, intentionally forcing each member to create outside of the tiresome redundancy of a four-piece band. Reluctant to hide behind a wall of reverb or instantly affiliate with a scene, they are focused on mirroring pop sensibilities while evoking a visual and vulgarized experience.______________________________________________________________________Depending on how much rain is falling the event may be able to move indoors at 99 Sudbury and run on the same schedule as if it were outside. In the unlikely event that the indoor venue is unavailable, we’ll be sure to let you know. A raincheck will be provided to a future screening.

Keeping with the West Indian theme, the menu will also include a baked Jerk Chicken with Coconut Rice, and Mango &amp; Jicama Coleslaw.\n\nIt would not be hyperbole to suggest that Greg Couillard is one of the most influential chefs in Toronto's culinary history. His prescient embrace of this city's multicultural flavours and ingredients revolutionized fine dining in Toronto, and foreshadowed the eclectic, international menus many now take for granted.\n\nLearn more about Workshops at The Depanneur\nhttp://thedepanneur.ca/workshops/",
